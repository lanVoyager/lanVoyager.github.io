# lanVoyager | toHave-N-haveNot

This is a repository for Lan's personal blog website, powered by Hexo and hosted on Github. 

Blog Website: https://lanvoyager.github.io/

# Intro

Besides documenting my backpacking journey in 2019-2020, the blog is a side project to keep myself entertained. I have basic knowledge in Javascript, HTML, and CSS and that's all I know about website development. 

The goal here was to hopefully create something interesting and learn some new languages.

Anyway, below is my requirements when I chose the blog generator:

- highly customizable or allow me to write some scripting. This is the entertainment part of it! Therefore, Facebook and WeChat are OUT! 
- FREE and Open Source
- Pretty according to my personal taste! My initial test readers, I know you don't like this current black and white theme. 

So I googled couple of hours and chose Hexo, again to my personal taste only not after lots of technical review. At that time, I didn't even know what is node.js, static site generator, etc. Who cares? Its name sounds nice and the sample themes are pretty.

To complete my simple review, it seems that the popular static site generators are:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)

# Hexo Requirements
Installing Hexo is quite easy and only requires the following beforehand:

- Node.js 
- Git

# My Picks for the Development
My picks for the blog theme and tools for development are soley based on the shallow reason, for their pretty apperances. But from a technical or nerdy aspect, so far the selections met all my requirements for developing and maintaining the blog.
- Hexo Theme: [NexT](https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next)

# Lessons Learnt
- Pickup JavaScirpt and CSS, with these two powerful skills I believe you can implement most features on Hexo blog! [Sample Implementation](https://lanvoyager.github.io/posts/cc037a0/#more)
- Add Interactive Maps [Sample Implementation](https://lanvoyager.github.io/posts/ddb3530/#more)
- Add Dynamic Feature into Static Framework [Sample Implementation](https://lanvoyager.github.io/posts/2ef3ae62/)

**Special Notes on Image Repository:** Due to the fact that popular cloud service like GoogleDrive, OneDrive, Dropbox are blocked in China, the pictures and audios on this blog are NOT viewable for readers from mainland China. In the inital development stage, I tried several options to find a bypass. But due to strict registration requirements for Chinese Cloud Service, I basically failed them all.
