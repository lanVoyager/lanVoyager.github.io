    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Chefchaouen is a small city in the Rif mountains in the north-west of Morocco. It is famous for its gorgeous blue alleys and blue-washed buildings. Millions of travelers visit it for its photo studio like alleys where you can take some perfect photos easily. Is it beautiful? Yes! But is it worth a visit? For me, the answer is NO or you may need to think it twice. It is located a little bit far away from major cities. From Fes, one-way bus is over FIVE hours. The town is really tiny and you can probably finish everything in 3-5 hours. And other than pretty blue alleys and buildings, I did not find too much to impress me.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hKvqyeNmICa6E8uC0-nvJRZy_qj2KaRD"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="The-Blue-Pearl-of-Morocco"><a href="#The-Blue-Pearl-of-Morocco" class="headerlink" title="The Blue Pearl of Morocco"></a>The Blue Pearl of Morocco</h1><p>Well, I was a little bit disappointed for my Chefchaouen visit. First, the pure return travel time I spent on this visit was over 12 hours on the bus but the town is so small that if you don’t spend 10 minutes for taking one picture, you can tour the entire town in 3-5 hours. Besides the high travel time and tour time ratio, I did not find too much to do in Chefchaouen other than just walking in the blue alleys. I only spend two days there and that was more than enough! In summary, it is a very touristic destination and very small…</p><p>But I have to admit the town is a photographer’s paradise. </p><h2 id="Blue-Alleys-and-Buildings"><a href="#Blue-Alleys-and-Buildings" class="headerlink" title="Blue Alleys and Buildings"></a>Blue Alleys and Buildings</h2><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lHtyjf1Iwx6sTKNCV7uc5_c0jRYM__sh"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YuMGpZ4aQbs0IftOwoE3b1GxsydhWh7Q"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gtrce41Men0kNeT_dm5Tq96y2Y4Qz83L"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1eYDpwNW4-4qsP-M6ukMMAmxTNzjwEBdR"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vl1_oD4D6-wO9b6oxcU8jaOJgqYLEtJa"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1eNVU3IJQM5yYPi6auXmqlaA2-70fPVG5"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1BAnsCWbO6DzCMYb87q7eQuhKrWjQo5Jj"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1csd0oSKK3kAMx0uvydrAo4GP9qE9OsQ_"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iDKZBogvNoFS3dMnd2pJ81NvMiP2nnG3"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Uk88Que2yMJ4Gs63r76N4-DSAZGb4rHt"><h2 id="Colorful-Shops-in-the-Blue-Town"><a href="#Colorful-Shops-in-the-Blue-Town" class="headerlink" title="Colorful Shops in the Blue Town"></a>Colorful Shops in the Blue Town</h2><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cLWsEe1XNsCkEhCdHE2oIGyqez-ig9VL"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fLcMPukDUUhDeO3xQ_K9001k6Qfbtwe2"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pSvfNwLVA7eyWP5J292qCkGmYVFGFOtT"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iHjOHcOf7UP3LFBMyTUEPmULyYozFJs1"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GSZsmUf05c-6VmCZIJErylnRg2jHiLAM"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1H4GeIALPdg5CUd6KoGm8rs551_D1JMmR"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1UKx2DxqfflYtN1g2YO0e_lQ0AV5KkWsN"><h2 id="Cat’s-Heaven"><a href="#Cat’s-Heaven" class="headerlink" title="Cat’s Heaven"></a>Cat’s Heaven</h2><p>I do not know why, but there are lots of street cats in almost every city in Morocco. In terms of life quality, I guess Chefchaouen is probably one of the best Moroccan cities for street cats. These cute creatures are everything in the blue alleys and seem to really enjoy their life while ignoring us, the human beings.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QlarFS1fCRE8kkWX3dgrkJPLqKy08hRn"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YMTzDfG86_vL7zR4Hrhk50cLQpEOG8Nh"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16LOhwmRi9jdEZe0IY_511r9oLpZQAkp6"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fS8-LczKXAfD2W-qx-39PmsVafbj3Ahe"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1L8N65hxLWFgK63iz9egPxXiyaqfp3NHP"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YEJSAvQYzSrkPXyN33YL3n43ocD6RAxZ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Prxfh06vKhxDP4S2-OMTwogIRkd1hCeN"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MjRKV6D7Lr-M0JdI3LIEHrPpQDZvEoW2"><h2 id="The-Lookout-Point-at-the-Spanish-Mosque"><a href="#The-Lookout-Point-at-the-Spanish-Mosque" class="headerlink" title="The Lookout Point at the Spanish Mosque"></a>The Lookout Point at the Spanish Mosque</h2><p>OK, for those outdoor activity lovers, there are some trails in the Rif mountains. Since I did not done any of the hiking trails in Chefchaouen, I could not provide further comments. </p><p>What I did was a short hike to the Spanish Mosque for an overview of the blue town. It’s easy to get to the trailhead from the town. Just exit the medina at the Eastern Gate or ask people for directions to Spanish Mosque. It hike up is about 1 mile each way and the walk up takes only 30-45 minutes. </p><p>The Spanish Mosque and the last hundred of steps.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16rDNii9G2VXeeqsaWIAv0TyeAjHxXxYS"><p>The overview of the blue town.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OQZzsGHozkYNfmv3rSJ0am3UwUn_04oF"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Elm87KY4XTy5h_XQCZvd8vE2ovvBv4Ea"><h2 id="Getting-to-Chefchaouen"><a href="#Getting-to-Chefchaouen" class="headerlink" title="Getting to Chefchaouen"></a>Getting to Chefchaouen</h2><p>Chefchaouen can be difficult to get to. As of 2020, there was no airport in Chefchaouen. So your choice is get there by bus. From north, the closest big city is Tangier. For south, Fes is the nearest city. No matter of where you start, plan for 3-5 hours one-way bus ride.</p><p>I started from Fes and the bus time is about 5 hours. The bus company is <a href="http://www.ctm.ma/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CTM</a>.</p><p>Once you get to Chefchaouen CTM bus terminal, you are about 1 mile away from the media of Chefchaouen. I walked there. Of course, you can take a taxi to the entrance of Medina.</p><h1 id="Food-in-Chefchaouen"><a href="#Food-in-Chefchaouen" class="headerlink" title="Food in Chefchaouen"></a>Food in Chefchaouen</h1><p>Apparently, Chefchaouen is a popular touristic destination among Chinese. How could I tell that? By the number of Chinese restaurants inside the city. </p><p><strong>Meal 1: Spicy Beef Noodles.

The land snails in their shell are boiled in a broth with a blend of Moroccan herb and spice.

Eat it by your hand and a toothpick. Also you can refill your soup as many as you like.</p><p>In terms of the taste, it’s hard to say. I personally do not find it very tasty but OK to finish my medium bowl. The soup tasted like Chinese herb medicine. But I was told it is good for your health. For a medium bowl, it costed me 7 dhs (~ 0.8 USD).</p><p><strong>Unknown Street Food</strong></p><p>I was not sure what it was. But this food cart was just next to the snail soup and there were lots of local people around it. So I tried it as well. The taste was like egg pudding and only costed 1 hds (~ 0.15 USD) for one piece without the bread. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aO2tH5GptDqLJi-kFJMH6Gvf9aJWWwy5"><h1 id="Log"><a href="#Log" class="headerlink" title="Log"></a>Log</h1><p>Chefchaouen stay from March 2 to March 3, 2020.</p><p>Next Stop 1: Fes, Morocco (Bus to Fes at 13:00, Mar 3, 2020).</p><p>Next Stop 2: Merzuga, Morocco (Bus to Merzuga at 20:30, March 6, 2020)</p><p>Final Stop: Casablanca, Morocco (Bus to Casablanca at 13:00, Mar 11, 2020 )</p><p><em>This post was published at Phoenix on August 24, 2020.</em></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The medina of Fes, Morocco’s former capital and third largest city, is made up of a far-reaching network of pedestrian roads – straight and winding, cobble-stoned and paved and gravel. Yes, the medina of Fes is the largest car-free area in the world. Donkeys are main ‘mode’ to transport goods and solid wastes in its narrow streets. Like most medinas in Morocco, be prepared to get lost. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Rx1qEZloWvVapL93SN_O4NW0RU0-QnsU"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="My-Unexpected-Long-Stay-in-Fes"><a href="#My-Unexpected-Long-Stay-in-Fes" class="headerlink" title="My Unexpected Long Stay in Fes"></a>My Unexpected Long Stay in Fes</h1><p>Located in the northern part of the country, originally on my itinerary, Fes was just my temporal base for Meknes, Chefchaouen and then to Merzuga. I was planning to continue my travel from Merzuga to Marrakesh to complete the big circle of Morocco and take a flight to Egypt and rest of the countries in Africa. However, life is full of uncertainties. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic escalated quickly and became a global health threat. Morocco has its first COVID-19 case confirmed on March 2, 2020.  I was very depressed upon hearing the news in Chefchaouen. It took me one day in my Fes hostel to struggle on making my decision if I should continue my trip. I had to admit that it was a bad time and situations were getting worse and worse everyday. No matter how heartbroken I was, I made up my mind to cancel my grand African backpacking plan and booked a direct flight back to the State on March 4, 2020. My date of the flight was on March 12 which still allowed me several days to visit the Sahara desert.</p><p>I was very depressed at that time. Although I still had time to Marrakesh from Merzuga once I was done with Sahara. I was not in the mood to do so and decided to come back to Fes and spend all my time before the flight hiding in my hostel. It was a terrible time for everyone and especially those who were traveling. Things are not getting any better, at least in the US still in August, 2020…Big sigh, I am not regretting for quitting my job for traveling but I did it at a wrong time….</p><p>Anyway, unexpectedly, Fes was the city where I spent my most of the time for this Moroccan travel. </p><h1 id="My-Unpleasant-First-Day-in-Fes"><a href="#My-Unpleasant-First-Day-in-Fes" class="headerlink" title="My Unpleasant First Day in Fes"></a>My Unpleasant First Day in Fes</h1><p>People come to visit Fes mainly for its oldest and largest authentic Medina. Me the same, at least my initial intention was to explore its media.</p><p>So I arrived Fes bus terminal from Casablanca and showed the taxi driver my riad address inside its medina. After about 20-minute’s drive, the driver dropped me off at a busy crowdy place and pointed me a gate to enter. I was totally at lost on where to go and what to do. I thought I would arrive right in front of the gate of my hostel. Yes, I did not know that medina of Fes is the world’s largest car-free area at that time.  I had to turn on my navigation App (Maps.Me) and try to find the hostel on my own.</p><p>Quickly several local people approached me asking if I needed help. I knew their tricks and politely said no. There was one young man kept following me for a while. He said he just wanted to be a friend and would help for free. Then I showed him my riad’s name and he led me to my hostel. He was nice at the beginning but as we got closer to my hostel, he started to ask me for tips. I felt cheated and quite unhappy but with my huge backpack, I decided to just give him some change and got my lesson learnt. So I kindly told him that I would find the riad on my own. But young men was so greedy and kept following me into my riad trying to get money from the riad’s owner and/or me. I got so annoyed and angry of him. So I put my luggage down. I walked to him and raised my voice telling him to return my money back. Not sure if it was due to my serious face or my tall figure, the young man ran away….Round one, WIN!</p><p>Fortunately, the host family of my Fes riad was very nice. The only problem was they do not speak English, but only some French and little Spanish. This making it very difficult to communicate with them. They have an English speaking assistant, named Hassan. The wife called him to assist for the check-in. I felt a little comfortable talking to Hassan at first. But again, it turned out that he was just another local guide and tried to sell all his service to me later in the day. The only good thing about him was that he was not as persistent as the men on the street. After telling him I was not interested in any of his service for couple of times, he let me free. </p><div class="note info">            <p><strong>Unwanted Guides and Assists</strong></p><p>I have travelled to many places, Fes is the winner of scammers, fake guides, and pushy salesmen. Trust me, they are quite annoying. You may be called, be approached and/or be followed by every corner of the alley in the Medina asking to be your guide or assistant. No matter how many times you said no, they are very persistent and they are everywhere! I had several bad experience with teenagers due to my Asian appearance. Yes, I am a Chinese. But after I turned their ‘friendly’ assistance down, the kids started to call me Corona…Um, not really feeling the hospitality and thank god I did not received their assistance. </p><p>In general, Moroccan people are very friendly and honest. However, it was really difficult to tell the difference between true hospitality and a tourist’s scam. So I always rejected helps from people on the street. </p>          </div><p>My suggestion is only ask for help if you absolutely need it, and if so only ask people inside their shops or traffic and police officers. </p><h1 id="Getting-Lost-in-Medina-of-Fes"><a href="#Getting-Lost-in-Medina-of-Fes" class="headerlink" title="Getting Lost in Medina of Fes"></a>Getting Lost in Medina of Fes</h1><p>Well, put my unpleasant experience aside. It was time to explore the medina.</p><p>Hassan told me that there are 365 mosques inside the medina?! Yes, call of the muezzin five times a day. No escape if you stay inside medina. For the first several days, my quality of sleep was really bad…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OUwfRFOdvoM9KtegDfm7u8maBOkS0kWS"><h2 id="Narrow-and-Windy-Alleys"><a href="#Narrow-and-Windy-Alleys" class="headerlink" title="Narrow and Windy Alleys"></a>Narrow and Windy Alleys</h2><p>Then the narrow, windy and cobble-stoned alleys inside the medina.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GJBC5c3jDR4LNaIG79REOOpBo31PoY8d"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13lhG9IOxPKEKP3k48IR-0FcG2d-uh-oU"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1zOsRjGXIemYzS2TWKk1c4SmFYy-l7cZc"> <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qv0i1WPYXOFV_9vPaa3B8LvMdq1-RZc0"><p>Now you probably understand why this is a car-free area. The alleys are so narrow and goes up and down making it impossible to drive any type of motor vehicles.</p><p>So donkeys are the main mode of transportation here.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1diwGieWPGKDsMezlQVNxJ_tb2T48MnrB"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1kWsdDz1dMVS0f0qrwqPiL2-oVfr6ekpt"><p>Another interesting thing I found in Morocco is that there are many many street cats in the country (for South America, they have street dogs and also many of them).</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_iZwcM6XJQ8gbgaJ_HRrSoty_74igHuz"><p>And the cute mom and baby cats in front of my riad. By the way, who could tell it is a riad? Honestly, it was very difficult to find it even with Maps.Me’s navigation.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OPrTQSAkuZM23LKpXVqHKQfNwQ3iNej8"><h2 id="Colorful-and-Chaotic-Market"><a href="#Colorful-and-Chaotic-Market" class="headerlink" title="Colorful and Chaotic Market"></a>Colorful and Chaotic Market</h2><p>The market inside the medina seems to be rough and raw. The streets are narrow and full of shops and street vendors. The crowds and size of the medina can be overwhelming and chaotic. Unless you are a local, you will ultimately get lost at some point. Talking about myself, I only know how to get back to my riad from a fixed starting point after staying there for more than a week…My suggestion is just to give up and flow with the crowd to explore it. </p><p>Copper products, leather slippers, bags, robes….</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1sdKqqNLBE0wF6L9x-v7zngtHpfOZGKaC"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HcDKyfeVgJSrG6VIHfsNAicocmV40sot"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1my-pUOa4KiMVIGkq74qFNkS5dDkHl1vb"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Xy7BMVYNZkkvYKpzLglLo2N21Sp8nNk5"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lG5JyMLRAoRb_8jmyJJ7R0BxJ42Wu1N6"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14i3QQUqIGvSJJ8HYBMkPo2JcQYEVEGwT"><p>Beautiful Moroccan china plates and tajine pots!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1n1UQr7wJ4L9hbbd3K1ZGYgVtd3YR44Ox"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=197tUK-TCFxz1YIeH5szwlv61AzcHL2UB"><p>The butcher’s store with a real hanging camel head…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18VntWwHaztZw4UYGfYbEIeyKNtNY8GBe"><p>I don’t know what the ladies were making seems to be some kind of pancake…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OZnAoPYrQACPN2-6iMEojjiBoW9V31NS"><p>I really don’t know what kind of flowers they are and how they are used.

Built during the 14th century, it holds a tiny yet impressive courtyard of the finest examples of Marinid craftsmanship. The walls are decorated with carved stucco ornamentation, mosaic tiles forming colorfl geometric patterns. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lTJsP6zfiPmMImwzqaNbEntCmRnGJrFy"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gNK0WEKl1_SMIrU6g3DxAs4PeGO3fpm9"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nST87NTLCgmw49cOODp__JPMqeilS58L"><p>One can climbed some stairs and reached rooms which used to host the students studying at the madrasa.

The University of al-Qarawiyyin, also written Al-Karaouine or Al Quaraouiyine, is considered to be the oldest university in the world.</p><p>Unfortunately, the university also functions as a mosque and non-Muslim visitors are NOT allowed inside the grounds. You can only have a look of its partial interior from one of its entrances. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mD2M9yWHVWGEIx9gX4SrbvcIKKojo734"><p>Alleys outside this university.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GBdoyY9hgDNIHvsG6Ba7aRnkkQvtAY5f"><h3 id="Chouara-Tannery"><a href="#Chouara-Tannery" class="headerlink" title="Chouara Tannery"></a>Chouara Tannery</h3><p>Well, visiting a tannery is probably listed a must-do activity when traveling in Fes. The medina is home to three ancient leather tanneries, the largest and oldest being the Chouara Tannery, which is almost a thousand years old.</p><p>No matter which one you visit, the most notable feature of these tannery is the numerous stone vessels filled with different colored dyes and while liquids. Even nowadays, they still use the ancient craft of tanning and dyeing techniques (cow urine and pigeon poop are still key components in the process). The dyes used in the tannery pits are natural: Blue comes from indigo; red, from poppy or paprika; yellow, from saffron, pomegranate, or even a mix of turmeric and mimosa flowers. As a result, the tannery is very STINKY! Bring a scarf or use fresh mint leaves to save your breathe!</p><p>The best way to get a panoramic view of the tannery is from one of the roof terraces. Well, remember the unwanted guides? You will meet lots of them insisting taking you to the best view point or bring you inside the tannery. Yes, it is difficult to find the place in this maze. But you need to know what you want to see. For a panoramic view from the roof terraces, you can just find a leather shop and pay some tips to their rooftops. Follow the signs like (Chouara Tannery) and you should be able to find one without too much trouble on your own! And once you are in the area, you will find people offering their rooftop terraces. I randomly picked one leather store and led by a salesman to its rooftop. He also provided me some fresh mint leaves. At the end of my visit, I was offered to have a tour of the leather shop. I didn’t purchase anything so I gave the men 10 dhs as a tip for the rooftop tour.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1m0L7M_3oFYO3nEidnlANsrKnY4xw0A6M"><p>It is also possible to have a tour inside the tannery. Back in the street, you can find the tannery’s main gate and the workers there offered me a tour for 30 dhs. I almost did that. However, as I walked 2 minutes into the tannery, I surrendered to the pungency of cow urine and pigeon poop. It was so overwhelming and I could hardly breathe even with the mint leave.</p><p>I guess this insider’s tour is only for those strong and tough people…</p><h1 id="A-Day-in-Meknes"><a href="#A-Day-in-Meknes" class="headerlink" title="A Day in Meknes"></a>A Day in Meknes</h1><p>Meknes, is one of the four Imperial cities of Morocco, located in northern central Morocco and the sixth largest city by population in the kingdom. “Laid-back with less hassle; a city has plenty to offer curious visitors; etc” are some of the descriptions I found from the internet. Since it is only one-hour away either by train or by bus, I decided to visit it.</p><p>Two main things people can do in Meknes is its medina or to <strong>Volubilis</strong>– the ruins of a Roman city dating back to the third century BC, locating about 40 minutes’ drive from Meknes.</p><p>I only visit the medina of Meknes. Personally, I found it was a little bit disappointing and will not recommend anybody to go. I think Fes already has everything and Meknes is not adding more new elements to my travel.</p><p>So for medina, everything is near Lahdim Square.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NGyPOawOOa-W_MjsR1suFbQfVip0bBpk"><p>Lunch of lamb tajine at Lahdim Square facing Bab Mansour Gate.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1h0EniLqLvipRWEgwPlgNtRH_dvzfI3by"><p>Gates and high walls of the medina.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=123sz_9sbwBSH1ch0AZpFKhT7zXrNzKJ3"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IbSNAQFcj5zulEyL0xrrnDBgc-FVpeVk"><p>Communities inside the medina.

My favorite alley in Meknes market.  </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vTn1J9El2fc3Llx6083gOrCggusK6tbf"><p>Oh, yes, I had my first inner cap of Hijab (head scarf) from this store. I guess only women and kids are allowed to enter the store…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QhOL4ZqHpspnGq1zpa7vgnWgHbYyhqBL"><p>Drum roll please! This was me with my hijab for the first time! Well, based on my understanding, what I had was just an inner layer, I probably need to have another real scarf outside it. I did not see any women wearing something like me directly…But friends, later I found this piece of thing is a GREAT product for traveling and outdoor. Think about it, it can be used as a scarf for coldness, use it for sun/wind/dust protection not only for your head, but neck and shoulder also if you pull it up, you can cover half of your face. I actually purchased 2 more in Fes for my future traveling needs.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vc9nGHm4xIDGT4uC62695LY1BI6d-jdp"><p>The very last thing of my visit to Meknes was the Moroccan’s train system.

You will find many outdoor coffees where people (mostly men) sitting, chatting and sipping their coffee. This Arabic coffee has a very concentrated flavor and is similar to espresso in strengths. As a black-coffee only person, I found it a little bit difficult to have it without sugar…yes, very very strong but I love it!</p><p>A must-try in Morocco! Avoid tourist cafes and find local cafes on the streets. A shoot of coffee is only 6 dhs (~ 0.6 USD) normally comes with a glass or a bottle of water!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DTfGGWJa9ywRa46KEbDkkBFK3_ApGNY8"><h2 id="Mint-Tea"><a href="#Mint-Tea" class="headerlink" title="Mint Tea"></a>Mint Tea</h2><p>Mint tea is the national Moroccan drink. This drink is provided by my riad in Fes on a daily basis. Oh my, it is my second favorite drink in Morocco! The ingredients are fresh mint, sugar, water and Chinese green tea. Believe it or not,  Morocco’s tea imports represent 25% of China’s worldwide tea exports. </p><p>Again, being a non-sweet tea drinker for most of my life, mint tea still tasted much better with sugar! See how much sugar intake increase I had in Morocco. Sweetened coffee in the morning and sweetened mint tea in the afternoon or early night…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KQeC6UTHBgPcayJ-31xMsromrPYTTOdw"><h2 id="Orange-Juice"><a href="#Orange-Juice" class="headerlink" title="Orange Juice"></a>Orange Juice</h2><p>This was for my daily Vitamin C intake.

Its name came from its earthenware pot made of clay or ceramic. The bottom is a wide, shallow circular dish used for both cooking and serving, while the top of the tajine is distinctively shaped into a rounded dome or cone so that all condensation returns to the bottom.</p><p>I think any types of meat can be tajined! </p><p><strong>Tajine One</strong></p><p>Beef Tajine Set Meal with Moroccan Side Dishes, Desserts. Costed: 150 dhs (~ 16 USD). The best tajine I had in Morocco.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18xr0zB8eSSbKp7IDcRlWGZKkjISp_3oF"><p>Note, this food presented on the table is for me and ONLY one-person. Yes, I have a big stomach!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1if_Nax1R2NwOrm1-g7RsluJzpbQcEKJc"><p>The dried prune and apricots added nature sweet taste into the beef stew, which perfectly fits my taste. Born and raised in Shanghai, we, Shanghainese, love to add sugar to almost every dish. I wonder if a people from northern or western part of China would like the sweet taste in a meat dish…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vHIqqfBta4j-3-WoL1PPCFtdJxlcCeO-"><p><strong>Tajine Two</strong></p><p>Chicken tajine set with soup at my Fes Riad.

It is made of small (about 3mm diameter) <strong>steamed balls of crushed durum wheat semolina</strong>. It is the “starch” staple of the region. In Morocco (as well as Tunisia, Algeria, Mauritania and Libya), couscous is generally served with vegetables (carrots, potatoes, turnips, etc.) cooked in a spicy or mild broth or stew, and some meat (generally, chicken, lamb or mutton). </p><p>It was interesting to try. But as a loyal rice fan, it is not my type of staple food.</p><p>This couscous plate costed 40 dhs (~ 4 USD) in medina of Fes.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wObVTQ5tOmBrZaE3uvk4HA2WEH_8Q3vU"><h2 id="Moroccan-Roasted-Chicken"><a href="#Moroccan-Roasted-Chicken" class="headerlink" title="Moroccan Roasted Chicken"></a>Moroccan Roasted Chicken</h2><p>It seems that you can find roasted chicken as a popular dish worldwide. There are quite a lot restaurants specialized in roasted chicken in Morocco.</p><p>I have to say, the winner of roasted chicken is still Peru!!!</p><p>Costed: 25 dhs (~ 3 USD)</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1byLsaTwnHXCpD3saTm1QdH0-702tcO25"><h2 id="Traditional-Moroccan-Halal-Breakfast"><a href="#Traditional-Moroccan-Halal-Breakfast" class="headerlink" title="Traditional Moroccan Halal Breakfast"></a>Traditional Moroccan Halal Breakfast</h2><p>“The word <strong>halal</strong> in Arabic means permitted or lawful. It is used to reference any behavior or object that is permitted under Islamic law. Therefore, <strong>halal</strong> foods are foods that are allowed to be consumed under Islamic dietary guidelines.”</p><p>I am not sure what is permitted and what is forbidden foods under Islamic law. But the breakfast at my Fes Riad was very delicious and more than enough for even a person with big stomach like me… Yes, I could not finish everything on the table.</p><p>So for a traditional Moroccan breakfast, breads, pancakes and cakes are commonly provided, accompanied with olives, honey, cheese and butter. As for beverages, freshly squeezed orange juice and of course the famous Moroccan mint tea. Personally, I also asked for a cup of coffee. And lastly, two fried eggs. Oh, how I love eggs.</p><p>This breakfast costed 20 dhs (~ 2 USD) at my Fes riad. If I don’t have an early morning bus or train to catch, I always had my breakfast at my riad!

How tiny it was? The bar can only accommodate 3-4 customers at one time…</p><p>I don’t know what I was ordering. Anyway, it only had two options. </p><p>Day 1: I tried soup Fassi. It had some diced vegetables, lentils, and chickpeas. Not exactly sure what were inside but very tasty and only costed 3 dhs (~ 0.35 USD).</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1plR63V8GstXId_xKiP_HJDdJiifFyFE1"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1stR80Ak4MCSn9B0XE4-7z3e_t7H-zpp_"><p>Day 2, I went to the same place and had soup de feves. Again very confused about what I had…Seemed like a soup made of beans. This soup was not as good as Fassi in my opinion. Costed 3.5 dhs (~ 0.4 USD).</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jVOEcY0Y2N3JMB3ISS3_jbpOgx1r_quo"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18sSYNrtx9KiFNLqa9Y4msXbkUwMkO2pG"><h2 id="Paella"><a href="#Paella" class="headerlink" title="Paella"></a>Paella</h2><p>I might be crazy to order a paella in Fes, which is surrounded by mountains. But I had enough tajine with bread and couscous was just not my type of staple food. I was craving for rice. </p><p>Anyway, Morocco is just an hour ferry away from Spain. </p><p>See food and paella station at the restaurant.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ro3pFaUVisO-K22MOShQ9gpEUIhAIVS2"><p>My rice…Honestly, taste was not that good.

It’s about 3-minute walking distance from Fes CTM bus terminal. I liked it so much that I went there twice during my stay in Fes. Note, it is not anywhere near Fes medina.</p><p>It offer Moroccan barbeque. You will need to buy your meat by the weight at one side of the restaurant and then bring it to the grill station on the other side.

      &lt;p&gt;The medina of Fes, Morocco’s former capital and third largest city, is made up of a far-reaching network of pedestrian roads – straight and winding, cobble-stoned and paved and gravel. Yes, the medina of Fes is the largest car-free area in the world. Donkeys are main ‘mode’ to transport goods and solid wastes in its narrow streets. Like most medinas in Morocco, be prepared to get lost. &lt;/p&gt;

My original plan for my 2020’s backpacking itinerary was first to China to finish my Tibet and Xinjiang Province then to Africa. Early January, I booked my flight to Shanghai in mid-February. Few days later, there were some news on coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China. As the situation escalated, U.S. airlines terminated most of the flights to China. Well, I was forced to cancel my visit to China and got refunds back in late January. </p><p>Well, I did not realize this would become a world-crisis. How innocent and optimistic I was! I thought nothing would stop me from traveling to Africa! There I went, Casablanca, Morocco!</p><p>My budget long flight took me through Los Angeles, then to Barcelona, Spain, and finally landed at Casablanca. During this 24+ hour, I did feel the Coronavirus’s impacts on international traveling. As one of the hub airport to China, almost all Chinese airlines has flight routes at LAX. Due to the flight suspension, there were rows and rows of check-in counters closed. Barcelona (BCN) was even worse. I was not sure if that was due to the covid-19. The BCN was half empty and two of its terminals were completely closed.</p><p>It was not a good start for my African trip…</p><h1 id="One-Day-in-Casablanca"><a href="#One-Day-in-Casablanca" class="headerlink" title="One-Day in Casablanca"></a>One-Day in Casablanca</h1><p>Casablanca is the largest city and chief port of Morocco. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MYxkKO12fu1RJOXO0oxnk1aiHmoKCaVQ"><p>I got to know this city from the famous Hollywood movie <em>Casablanca</em>. To backpackers and tourists, the city is used as the transport hub to Fes or Marrakech. Personally, although it is a beautiful modern city, I did not find too much to do there. One day stay is enough to explore the city. </p><h2 id="Hassan-II-Mosque"><a href="#Hassan-II-Mosque" class="headerlink" title="Hassan II Mosque"></a>Hassan II Mosque</h2><p>Sitting on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, Hassan II Mosque is the largest functioning mosque in Africa and is the 7th largest in the world</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16_beC0s_eadidcusKH545_6vDhn9IfEZ"><p>It’s one of Morocco’s top architectural wonders. The Mosque that was commissioned by King Hassan II, is one of the top things to do in Casablanca, taking seven years to build and holding up to a maximum of 105,000 worshippers can gather together for prayer: 25,000 inside the mosque hall and another 80,000 on the mosque’s outside ground</p><p>Now some information on Muslims and Islam, which I found useful to know to respect the religion, the culture, the people during my trip in Morocco.</p><div class="note info">            <p><strong>A mosque</strong> is a place of worship for Muslims. Mosques commonly serve as locations for prayer, Ramadan vigils, funeral services, Sufi ceremonies, marriage and business agreements, alms collection and distribution, as well as homeless shelters. Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche (mihrab) set into the wall that indicates the direction of <strong>Mecca</strong>, <strong>ablution facilities</strong> (Wudu) and <strong>minarets</strong> from which calls to prayer are issued.</p><p><strong>Wudu</strong> is the Islamic procedure for cleansing parts of the body, a type of ritual purification, or ablution. Wudu consists of washing the face, arms, then wiping the head and finally washing the feet with water and is an important part of ritual purity in Islam. </p><p>A common feature in mosques is the <strong>minaret</strong>, the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The tallest minaret in the world is located at the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, Morocco. Before the five required daily prayers, a <strong>Mu’adhdhin</strong> calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. </p><p>The English word <strong>muezzin</strong>, derived from Arabic word <strong>Mu’adhdhin</strong>, is the person appointed at a mosque to lead and recite the call to prayer for every event of prayer and worship in the mosque. The muezzin’s post is an important one, and the community depends on him for an accurate prayer schedule. <em>The call of the muezzin is considered an art form, reflected in the melodious chanting of the adhan.</em></p><p>The <strong>five daily prayers</strong> are obligatory (<em>farz</em>) and they are performed at times determined essentially by the position of the Sun in the sky. Hence, salat times vary at different locations on the Earth. <strong>Wudu</strong> is need for all prayers. </p><p>Lan’s experience on the call of the muezzin and five daily prayers, no offense here, but as a non-muslim traveler, I found it a little difficult to have a good continuous and undisrupted sleeping time-window…So that is really FIVE prayers per day and if you stay in the old medina, you will hear the call of the muezzin from like next door while you are taking a nap in the afternoon, at night or really early in the morning like (4-5 am)…Anyway, 5 prayers times are:</p><ul><li>Fajr (dawn): true dawn or the beginning of twilight, when the morning light appears across the full width of the sky – and ends at sunrise.</li><li>Dhuhr (midday)</li><li>Asr (afternoon)</li><li>Maghrib (sunset): The Maghrib prayer begins when the sun sets, and lasts until the red light has left the sky in the west.</li><li>Isha (night): The Isha’a or isha prayer starts when the red light is gone from the western sky, and lasts until the rise of the “white light” (fajr sadiq) in the east. The preferred time for Isha is before midnight, meaning halfway between sunset and sunrise.</li></ul>          </div><p>This mosque is a showcase of finest Moroccan artisanship with hand-carved stone and wood, intricate marble flooring and inlay, gilded cedar ceilings and exquisite <em>zellige</em> (geometric mosaic tilework) abound.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZMcgphoMpDjx5q8XfBxd8jzDq6cptEKh"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1saSBMrBQQIgn5XvjLcEfBwFTzQoavK9c"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1U4CI1ooQoWALMCz65H4QYKHhnUTSB1p1"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1U4CI1ooQoWALMCz65H4QYKHhnUTSB1p1"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MkWCLdm0JXn4_wB3La4PtXCz9gakLa8q"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lh_Eh9FFpeO58QeHJ3PCJ2ev62cbfcO4"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1VtRoIicHY59lsU5n8BfrkMq1J7-ypT95"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1B_Xbmfuit19GpDwU6io2XPFgoY4gkkcv"><h3 id="Guided-Tour"><a href="#Guided-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Guided Tour"></a>Guided Tour</h3><p>Hassan II mosque is one of few mosques that are open to non-Muslims in the country.

The price for this 1-hour guided tour is 140 dhs (~ 15 USD).</p><p>The size and elaborate decoration of the prayer hall is simply spectacular.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yoRyaBC-vnPLJyvKbg3sTzq4vAxslu9n"><p>And the second floor for women. Yes, mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women. Thanks for my international studying/work experience with many classmates and colleagues from middle-east, I was equipped with some basic knowledge about the Muslim culture and religion. One senior lady (from Canada or U.S.) got very upset when the tour guide explained gender separation. There was a 2-minute heated discussion on this issue… </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15hsQzH2IHtH85AhXNrT9hnuShDdJ6Rnd"><p>Beautiful wood work of the platform for women’s pray area.

No, no, no, this Rick’s Cafe is not over 70 years old but a re-creation of frictional saloon owned and founded by a former American diplomat, Kathy Kriger. While themed for this Hollywood movie, this is a serious restaurant with a great ambience, service and food. The restaurant has a dress code. I was lucky to had my lunch there with just outdoor outfits…A kind suggestion is to dress up. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1o0_IrcOuI7F4tcDMzWb13HHw2AgS1le6"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YxS9CHeXvWnicFzbXStuteR71_j7qIf0"><p>And, my first formal meal in Morocco, lamb shank with dried prunes and saffron rice. Super delicious!!!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1I4J9_0rCVvv_6YATbQHMofh-x03Ws9S1"><p>Another note, smoking is allowed inside the restaurant. Later I found, it is allowed inside most of the restaurants, bars, hostels, train stations and even airport?! If this bothers you, you may try to ask for a non-smoking section which I am not sure if that is something exists there. </p><h1 id="Food-in-Casablanca"><a href="#Food-in-Casablanca" class="headerlink" title="Food in Casablanca"></a>Food in Casablanca</h1><p>Well, technically I only had two nights and one day stay in Casablanca.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My second visit to Buenos Aires and actually this time was my farewell to South America. After over four-month backpacking, I felt a little bit exhausted and found the excitement gain from traveling was diminishing at that point. So I decided to take a break from backpacking and return to my sweet home in Phoenix. But still I had couple of days to explore Buenos Aires’ passion for Tango!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QAfwCmZYX88lWJdAFCmL4OG3Xet1hLbG"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="More-Walking-Tours-in-Buenos-Aires"><a href="#More-Walking-Tours-in-Buenos-Aires" class="headerlink" title="More Walking Tours in Buenos Aires"></a>More Walking Tours in Buenos Aires</h1><p>Yes, I mentioned TANGO as the keyword for my last several days in Buenos Aires. But they were for the nights. So I took the opportunities to explore the city.</p><h2 id="A-Day-Walk-in-BA’s-Parks"><a href="#A-Day-Walk-in-BA’s-Parks" class="headerlink" title="A Day Walk in BA’s Parks"></a>A Day Walk in BA’s Parks</h2><p>Buenos Aires is known for its wealth of beautiful green spaces. This South American city has a huge French influence when it comes to urban planning and landscape design, and this can be felt in the city’s charming outdoors. On any sunny day, you will find people lounging while sipping the national drink mate, sunbathing, biking, or walking their dog through one of the city’s 250 parks within city limits. </p><p>My hostel Selina at Palermo Soho happens to be near some of the most beautiful parks in Buenos Aires, including Jardin Botanico, Eco Parque, Bosques de Palermo and Jardin Japones.</p><p>Among those, my personal favorites are Eco Park and Bosques de Palermo.</p><h2 id="Eco-Park"><a href="#Eco-Park" class="headerlink" title="Eco Park"></a><strong>Eco Park</strong></h2><p>Once a zoo, this park is being transformed to an educational, animal-friendly eco-park. In June 2016, the Buenos Aires City Government took the decision to close the 140-year-old Buenos Aires Zoo and release about 2,500 animals (the majority of the zoo’s population) into the wild because it believed that nowadays it was no longer acceptable for animals to be kept captive. The work is ongoing, but several areas are already open to public.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YX8qzI63DtHlhKm5rwZ-HJPh_V2hqfyP"><p>You will find ducks, maras, peacocks and other species that wander freely in an area that recreates a natural habitat of ponds and pasture. </p><p>These are cute maras. It is also known as the Patagonian cavy, Patagonian hare, or dillaby. This herbivorou, somewhat rabbit-like animal is found in open and semiopen habitats in Argentian, including large parts of Patagonia.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SnXgL4g9wwawdz_2hOFTDexI-81v-imr"><p>And a peacock on the side-walks.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1A3t61IsMZU9EtKuCr-dJBlKmOA_dBNSe"><p>Another somehow semi-caged beautiful animal, Guanaco. I had seen those creatures in Patagonia. However, they were very far in distance and I could not take a good photo of them. But finally, I had this one.  </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12DeMAgGo0_i8M5OdaRCF-IAMVs6CJxzQ"><h3 id="South-American-Camelids-In-A-Nutshell"><a href="#South-American-Camelids-In-A-Nutshell" class="headerlink" title="South American Camelids In A Nutshell"></a>South American Camelids In A Nutshell</h3><p>By now I have collected all mysterious species in South America, llama, alpaca, vincuna and guanaco. It would be a perfect time to give you some information on those animals.</p><p>Long story in short, llamas are the domesticated form of the guanaco and alpacas are domesticated form of vicuna. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1VT_7QZTzGRdBc8kHasUzqcwJBa_K6a5Q"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1t5oBHTFrxPju_cJspr-BvO1AIRPCRKFL"><p><em>Two Photos Reference from Internet</em></p><p>Vicuña has the finest animal fiber in the world and they only produce about a pound of wool every year making it the most expensive fiber in the world! Because of the quest for its highly coveted luxurious fiber, the Vicuña was driven nearly to extinction by the 1960s. Various conservation programs have ensured survival of the Vicuña, and this wonderful fiber is once again available to the textile industry. There are now approximately 150,000 Vicuñas in South America, about 80% of which inhabit Peru.</p><p>While Vicuña are charming and delicate Andean animals, my personal favorite is alpacas for their silly faces and cute rounded body shapes covered by their fur. Actually, their fur is the second finest animal fiber in the world. By the way, I also tasted very tender and delicious alpaca meat. Sorry, I should not have eaten those cute animals… I won’t do it again!</p><p>The guanaco is an extremely versatile animal, and its territory ranges from Ecuador and Colombia in the North to Patagonia and even Tierra del Fuego in the South. Guanacos can live at extremely high altitudes, and they can also survive on very little water, as is evidenced by the populations in the Atacama desert. Guanaco wool is better than llama wool (especially the soft undercoat) but is considered inferior to alpaca or vicuña wool.</p><p>Ever since their domestication about 5000 years ago, llamas have been used predominantly as pack animals, and in many parts of the Andes they are still the only form of transportation. They are also used for their meat and their wool. Sorry to say that llama both the taste of their meat and quality of their wools are inferior to those of alpacas!</p><p>In summary, the value and quality of fiber ranking is the following (best to worst): Vicuña - Alpaca - Guanaco - Llama.</p><h2 id="Bosques-de-Palermo"><a href="#Bosques-de-Palermo" class="headerlink" title="Bosques de Palermo"></a>Bosques de Palermo</h2><p>Bosques de Palermo or simply “Palermo Parks” is one of the largest and most stunning parks in the city. With a lake, plenty of trees, walking trails and classical gardens, it is a local favorite for families, fitness fanatics and couples on a romantic date.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1CnWSsewpBOFpXRdigaZ1FEUD5dONx2ON"><p>The highlight of this park is the Rosedal (Rose Garden), a little piece of heaven with a diverse collection of roses surrounded by pretty bridges, galleries and statues.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SC5nwLefzTFs6IXSWrMyzVBc-tggzLPZ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1U2Iz5xhfs1Sr1m2icxGRnVvxm8UmnqOI"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ygc4C4fqMC7TaiCFx3S_W72wkFYdCujo"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fhILsjMi70Zt9J60Sb0jzdtOzlQgc5ZD"><p>And the row of cafes and restaurants just outside the park!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1TRAJqG6qskVUSJfRiPVnVAjJXug_-iq0"><h2 id="San-Telmo-Market"><a href="#San-Telmo-Market" class="headerlink" title="San Telmo Market"></a>San Telmo Market</h2><p>If you happen to be in Buenos Aires on a Sunday, you should not miss the <strong>San Telmo market</strong>! This market opens <strong>every Sunday from about 10 am to 4 pm</strong> and nested in one of the oldest neighborhoods (<strong>San Telmo</strong>) in Buenos Aires. Besides all types of antiques and handicrafts that represent the traditions of Argentina, the cobblestone streets and bohemian historic cafes also make a perfect frame to spend your time there. Also a good place to grab some last minute souvenir, you would find handmade mate sets, leather products, paints, arts, painted t-shirts and much more! Come and explore!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pep8D7UoikP1F0U0zdod7Y7eWXjMsIMY"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Eah9ctdpEzVQBhJsoXUEsBlme-BpUKNH"><h2 id="Recoleta-Cemetery"><a href="#Recoleta-Cemetery" class="headerlink" title="Recoleta Cemetery"></a>Recoleta Cemetery</h2><p>I have no idea why cemeteries can become popular tourist attractions in South America. Remember my visit to the <strong>General Cemetery</strong> in Sucre, Bolivia? I was in Buenos Aries, and Recoleta cemetery is considered to be one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world and a must see site in the city. This final resting place of many of Argentina’s wealthiest and most famous families contains no less than 6,400 graves. Each one is unique, constructed in homage to a wide assortment of architectural styles</p><p>For those who are interested to learn more about Argentina’s history and the cemetery, you may consider to join a <a href="https://www.buenosairesfreewalks.com/recoleta-cemetery-tour/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">‘free’ walking tour</a>. Or you can do your homework online before you go.</p><p>If you are like me, not a big fan of history, you can just go on your own. The cemetery is very easy to locate and free to enter. Just take Line H and get off at metro station Plaza Francia.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1W8lP3F0qfIhZ4mbsrP0SA_Z4__Gg7jIs"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uvr7Y0FkwoSIbbCxPsdmq-_przpXTYa0"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QNdoKeosIILiRQbf64kR6yiZeKG2IcBr"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FneLHVU54d5psfDYsrSgcoeOQ1F48THF"><h1 id="The-Capital-of-Tango"><a href="#The-Capital-of-Tango" class="headerlink" title="The Capital of Tango"></a>The Capital of Tango</h1><div class="note info">            <p><strong>Tango</strong> is a partner dance, and social dance that originated in the 1880s along the Río de la Plata, the natural border between Argentina and Uruguay. It was born in the impoverished port areas of these countries, with enslaved African populations. The tango is the result of a combination of African Candombe, Spanish-Cuban Habanera, and Argentinian Milonga.</p><p>The tango is improvised, aggressive and erotic. Every move symbolizes el amor y la passion – love and passion.</p>          </div><p>Buenos Aires is the birthplace and capital of tango. The city is full of tango as you will find dancers on the street of La Boca, San Telmo, city center and many more. Honestly, I was not gifted in dancing and singing at all. My mom once said I have the ‘Zombie Dancing Style’…</p><p>But I was in Buenos Aires, you can feel the city’s passion and love for Tango. To enjoy the dance, one have several options to choose from elaborate stage shows to neighborhood milongas (dancing halls) or even sign up for tango lessons. Well, I did not want to embarrass myself with my zombie movements so tango lessons was obviously not my choice. </p><h2 id="Tango-Porteno"><a href="#Tango-Porteno" class="headerlink" title="Tango Porteño"></a>Tango Porteño</h2><p>Buenos Aires offers many opportunities to see impressive theatrical tango shows, often with live orchestras and a luxury dinner and show combination. It would be really difficult to choose which tango show to go since there are hundreds of them in BA. I was given dozens of tango show fliers as I walked along Florida Avenue. But one day, I was came across <a href="https://tangoporteno.com.ar/eng/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tango Porteño</a> (a theater) next to <strong>Teatro Colón</strong>. I asked the box office for the price and show time and finally picked this one as my Tango Show in BA. </p><p>The location is a tourist attraction in itself. It used to be a well-know theater of Buenos Aires and still conserves the precious details of that time of splendor. And below is a description of the show from the website:</p><div class="note info">            <p><strong>Tango Porteño brings us to the golden era of tango: the 40s in Buenos, where everything was tango.</strong> The great orchestras competed to be in vogue, the dancers spent tracks with new steps, and everyone spoke of fierce tango sounded by these latitudes. Tango Porteño magically recreates all this with <strong>the deployment of a Broadway musical comedy style. 30 artists on stage</strong>, live orchestra, 8 dance couples and 2 singers, with luxurious costumes and the unique setting of a vintage movie theater that today becomes the big stage of this unforgettable show.</p>          </div><p>Depends your seat location and whether dinner is included, the price can go up to 100+ USD per person. For me, I had the cheapest option, show only for 1380 ARS (~ 24 USD) and entering time was 10 p.m.</p><p>So I arrived at busy downtown at night and entered the theater. Embarrassingly, I found myself an outlier inside it…Most people were well dressed, men in suits and ladies in dresses with makeups and high heels. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MGHcFgU-ylFnzCtH_WtStdpGt8MPT0zt"><p>So how I looked? I had hiking pants, T-shirt and outdoor Northface long sleeve shirt with clumsy hiking shoes. What’s even worse? I was wearing a pair of sunglasses at night and ready for theatrical tango show?! The sunglasses was not my fault. I lost my prescription glasses in Paine and since then I had the sunglasses on me. Oh my, I even did star-gazing with sunglasses in El Calafate and found the Southern Cross (Crux). I had to order something to drink to numb my embarrassment!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-ojgZ0Xbw-PjTqmPFB8IvLpwYUknQH4n"><p>It was a totally random pick but turned out to be a wonderful experience! A bonus of this show is for its location! Even after midnight, I was still able to find a bus back to my hostel! You know as a stingy backpacker, getting a taxi was always to be avoided and reserved to be the last-resort! </p><h2 id="Milonga-Parakultural"><a href="#Milonga-Parakultural" class="headerlink" title="Milonga::Parakultural"></a>Milonga::Parakultural</h2><p>To experience true spirit of tango, one has to visit one milonga!</p><div class="note info">            <p>The <em>milonga</em> is a very special thing. The simple description is an organized event where people can dance tango. The word <em>milonga</em> also is a type of tango music and a style of dance that is performed to that music. </p><p>But remember tango is <strong>a late night sport</strong>. Most <em>milongas</em> don’t really get going until after 12 midnight. And the best dancers don’t rock up until 2-3 am when they put on some spectacular live performances to show the crowd how it’s really done. </p>          </div><p>I did not even know the word milonga and that was not on my to-do list. So I ran into several street dancers while wandering in Buenos Aires during my first stay. I stopped to watch them dancing and one lady approached me asking if I were interested in tango lessons and customized local tango tours. My personal traveling rule number one was not never book anything from random people on the street. So I politely told her that I was not planning to have tango tour anytime soon but maybe later after my Iguazu visit. So the lady, Melisa, gave me her WhatsApp contact.</p><p>After the tango show, I really liked what I saw. Plus my flight back to U.S. was at 6 a.m. I thought it would be a perfect last night event in BA which meant taxi to airport directly upon return from milonga. I told you tango is a late night sport and people keep dancing until 4-5 am?!</p><p>So Melisa and her dancing partner took me to <strong><a href="http://www.parakultural.com.ar/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Milonga Parakultural</a></strong>. Friends, it is considered to be one of the best milonga in general and definitely best wooden dance floor in Buenos Aires. For the latter, I will leave it to those who can dance tango. Check out the lady in black dress in the photo, she was in her seventies and still came here frequently to dance from start to the end! No wonder locals say tango is not a hobby but a lifestyle!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QAfwCmZYX88lWJdAFCmL4OG3Xet1hLbG"><p>Live orchestra and singing performance started at around 1 a.m.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15mrzopDg1wx6PHhjkC7STMKt2_amC3qM"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HohgpXlQ5hoaG2S8Ct2m8vLHDvfO3lxP"><p>The live tango performance started at around 2:15 a.m. Really, that late! </p><p>The cost for this milonga tour was 45 USD for one person and 30 USD each for two or more people, including hotel pickup and drop off. I think you may go to milongas without a guide. And <strong><a href="http://www.parakultural.com.ar/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Milonga Parakultural</a></strong> is a tourist-friendly tango club which welcomes spectators. But the benefits of having guides are they will explain the culture, the rules, the codes in milongas and of course, if you want you can dance with them! </p><h1 id="Don-Julio-for-My-Farewell"><a href="#Don-Julio-for-My-Farewell" class="headerlink" title="Don Julio for My Farewell"></a>Don Julio for My Farewell</h1><p>For most of my stay in BA, I either went to Asian restaurants or cooked at hostel’s common kitchen. No matter how I like it, I really had too much Argentinean grill. </p><p>But before my return to the states, I decided to have my farewell party at an Argentinean steak house . Where did I choose?</p><p>Drum roll please!</p><p>The famous <strong><a href="http://www.parrilladonjulio.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Don Julio</a></strong>! It is considered not only the best steak house in Buenos Aires, but ranking <strong>the World’s 50 Best restaurants, Nº34.</strong></p><p>Side note, my hostel Selina is just half block away from this famous restaurant.  Again, I only knew Don Julio is famous but did not know it ranks the World’s best restaurants at that time…</p><p>So it is famous and it is great! Therefore, no matter when you go, you will probably find a long queue outside the restaurant. But they serve free champagne for waiting customer!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ds56SngyDdvbX3ATtUdrcU9Q54PeC3Yf"><p>After an hour, I was able to get a space at the bar, which was not too bad. But if you can, wait for a real table. </p><p>The busy grilling station.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1UmiYEP63I5YvSi4KSx3RWvN85PluMElz"><p>So I was ready for ordering my steak! Don Julio has a long list of meat cuts from the grill. I was a little confused on what to order. So the waiter took me the the other side of the bar and asked this from the grill station.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1d2RkJ9OG44x78KJ1WwcFNJ5feC5EmKhq"><p>On the pan of meat, there are rib eye, thin sirloin, thick sirloin, butterfly sirloin, thin flank, tenderloin, T-bone, short ribs and entrecote!</p><p>Great, I went for a challenge of 1kg of meat, the entrecote!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Hx4ZNayxHzMHIVx4kCohkk6mfVn8fPQ2"><p>A huge piece of steak with bones grilled to perfection! I was very satisfied for this plate. And it costed 1950 ARS (~ 33 USD). Money well spent and I was ready for my flight back to U.S.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wJOxUTCgRvfTdw6HIxfN_QtUuQdL1qBy"><h1 id="Log"><a href="#Log" class="headerlink" title="Log"></a>Log</h1><p>Buenos Aires last stay from December 20 to December 24, 2019.</p><p><strong>Return HOME</strong>: Phoenix, AZ, U.S. (Flight to Phoenix 06:00, Dec. 24, 2019).</p><p><em>This post was published at Phoenix on August 6, 2020.</em></p>]]></content>

Brazilian side offers the most panoramic views of Iguazu Falls, while the Argentinean side allows visitors to see the waterfalls up-close. It is said that the Brazilian side is for viewing the falls and the Argentinean side is for experiencing them.</p><h2 id="Brazilian-Side"><a href="#Brazilian-Side" class="headerlink" title="Brazilian Side"></a>Brazilian Side</h2><p>The Parque Nacional do Iguazu in Brazil only has one circuit of approximately 1500 meters. But during all the journey you will have a constant panoramic view of the Iguazu Falls, which allows you to appreciate it from many angles. Given its smaller size, you plan 2-4 hours inside the park for visit. Another good news is that from Puerto Iguazu, there are buses taking you right in front of this Brazilian National park in an hour or so including border crossing!</p><p>The entrance fee is R$ 72 (~ 18 USD).</p><h2 id="Argentinean-Side"><a href="#Argentinean-Side" class="headerlink" title="Argentinean Side"></a>Argentinean Side</h2><p>The Iguazu National Park on the Argentine side is larger in size and has <strong>6 different circuits</strong> connected by Jungle Trains. Some trails provide the opportunity to walk across several of the falls via catwalk and to overlook the water flowing over the edges and some offers the best close-up views of the falls. It is possible to finish all 6 circuits and a boat tour in one day. But you need to be the first group to enter the park and walk really fast on the trails.</p><p>The entrance fee is 800 ARS (~ 14 USD).</p><h1 id="My-Visit-to-Iguazu-Falls"><a href="#My-Visit-to-Iguazu-Falls" class="headerlink" title="My Visit to Iguazu Falls"></a>My Visit to Iguazu Falls</h1><p>My base for the Iguazu visit was <strong>Puerto Iguazu</strong>, Argentina. Upon stepping outside of the airport, I realized that there I was in the humid and hot tropical climate again! There were shared airport shuttle. For only 250 ARS (~4 USD), the shuttle dropped me off at my house (yes, a 2-story townhouse for my own!) in Puerto Iguazu. </p><h2 id="Explore-Brazilian-Side"><a href="#Explore-Brazilian-Side" class="headerlink" title="Explore Brazilian Side"></a>Explore Brazilian Side</h2><p>From Iguazu’s bus terminal, there is a bus company providing direct transport between the falls on the Brazilian side and Puerto Iguazu. It is very easy and comfortable. The bus ride including border crossing is about 1 hour.</p><p>I took the earliest bus the next day to Brazil! My original plan was spent half-day at the Brazilian side and finish one or two trails in the Argentinean side in the afternoon. It did not work out as planned. Due to the long waiting time to enter the park, I actually spent almost whole day in Brazil. But I did more than planned there.</p><p>The ride was comfortable and border crossing was very fast. The weather was sunny that day by the time I arrived the park. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Oe-msic8cRklAPtgIFqfG-nrkBeifJFw"><p>However, it took me almost 2-3 hours to get on the trail? First I encountered a long queue at the ticket box. Then another queue just to enter the park. Finally, an endless queue for getting on the bus to the trail head. This was the scene for the final queue, packed with crying babies, shouting kids and exhausting parents. It reminded me of Disney Park…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HwUpLYfK4a6HCRReEMQ58uh6P4c0NA1B"><p>After a long time waiting, finally I boarded on a cute Disney-like animal painted double-decked bus!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1712b6t4eagSNzqabs35J5_WzIx4-SpGT"><p><em>“My poor Niagara …”</em></p><p>That is what Eleonor Roosevelt said when she saw Iguazu Falls. I had the same feeling when Iguazu Falls came to my view for the first time. I had been to many falls, including Niagara. Innocent me! In my mind at that time, I thought Niagara Falls is the largest in the world! But all my ‘ex-waterfalls’ have nothing to compare to Iguazu Falls!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ld9BtJeyQEpdhbSTjRAyr4uzo5spftDV"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jwJmuDdlDfXSaFiHnZ0oxlIxhLhcRtfu"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=141KR801ADd1nDR1rQo_aBwAIaQsUaNPQ"><p>Devil’s Throat at a far distance.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Cu3uUgCcQM6EKvXxNLAJyB4--kK9FgKm"><p>At the end of the circuit, you would find yourself just over 100 meters from Devil’s Throat. Be prepared to get wet!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OZ1dnwnF_bMaaEJjYgSXyib7qAVrWbmv"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=158c_PUX9VEhrV8e3gVpSDD9PU7Zsgo4L"><p>Although completing the 1.5 km circuit only costed me less than 2 hours, it was too late for me to return to the Argentinean park for the same day that afternoon due to the long waiting time spent just to enter the park and get on the bus. I decided to spent more time in the park for the day. Inside the park, you will find boat tour, jungle trekking, and rafting and river tour. I signed up for rafting and saved boat tour to the foot of the waterfalls in Argentina the next day. </p><p>The dock to the rafts.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1x3Fq_EaSYTy7KtX5lzgRWTRvXM56LuCD"><p>The rafting tour was only about 30 minutes on the water. To be fair, it was definitely not a whitewater rafting experience. We only had about 5 minutes moving on easy rapids. But at the end of the tour, you can swim in the river! This is probably the only tour which allows swimming experience! </p><p>By the way, the cost for this 30-minute rafting tour was R$ 136 (~ 34 USD).</p><p>Swimming or getting wet was something I planned. I didn’t have spare clothing for exchange. So I was drying myself under the sun. I guess the bus drivers are used to ‘wet’ travelers and I was not rejected to enter the buses. Thanks to the hot weather, by the time I returned to my townhouse, everything was almost dried… </p><p>Note: remember to bring some spare clothing for exchange no matter if you have any water-related activities planned.</p><h2 id="Hiking-the-Argentinean-Side"><a href="#Hiking-the-Argentinean-Side" class="headerlink" title="Hiking the Argentinean Side"></a>Hiking the Argentinean Side</h2><p>Learnt from my experience at the Brazilian side, I was in front of the park entrance 30 minutes before the opening time. Yes, the first bus there was at 7 am and it only took half an hour to get there.</p><p>That day, I had a long to-do list, taking the boat tour and complete all 6 circuits in the park! I was among the first group to enter the park at 8 a.m. sharp! It was proved that complete all 6 circuits and a boat tour in one day was possible!</p><h2 id="Boat-Safari"><a href="#Boat-Safari" class="headerlink" title="Boat Safari"></a>Boat Safari</h2><p>Unfortunately, it was raining heavily that morning. So before my boat tour, I was already all wet…</p><p>The boat safari was 3,000 ARS (~ 50 USD) as of December 2019 and started off with an relaxing drive through the jungle. During the ride, there was a guide providing information about plants and animals living in the area.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1x_rqFZJU8l0RRizoyGTe8Jiw1nopU5Tl"><p>After the ride, there was an easy walk down to the launching point on Iguazu River.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-FPUZunx7RqWh3jvWaN-QpSyDQ9Jp2H3"><p>You would get really close and get under the waterfalls.

      &lt;p&gt;I have visited many other waterfalls before, including Niagara Falls. So I thought, well, Iguazu was just another waterfalls to put on my ‘been-to’ list. I was WRONG again! When I came face to face with the astounding Iguazu Falls, I was turned into a raving fan of its natural beauty and pure magic – a chain of hundreds of waterfalls nearly 3km in extension! This is one of the most beautiful natural wonders I’ve ever seen and something not to miss when traveling in South America! Bonus, no heavy hiking or physical activities are required there. So bring your family, your kids there!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a one-hour ferry ride from Buenos Aires, <strong>Colonia del Sacramento</strong> is located at the tip of a short peninsula with a strategic position on the north shore of the Río de la Plata. “Colorful colonial houses, picturesque cobblestone streets, the sweet smell of fresh water, and ancient fortification.” This sentance describes what to expect in Colonia.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1U3-S0gY-MlpagQwZ0MORwPoHcqfQ9Mi8"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="A-Town-with-Colorful-Windows"><a href="#A-Town-with-Colorful-Windows" class="headerlink" title="A Town with Colorful Windows?!"></a>A Town with Colorful Windows?!</h1><p>Colonia was not on my initial South American itenery but was highly recommended by a Korean girl I met in Lima. We both stayed at Selina in Lima for almost a week. The Korean girl only speaks little English, but we managed to chat via Google Translate, body language and guessing almost everyday in the common kitchen. One day, I told her that I would visit Buenos Aires. She took out her cell phone and said you have to visit here! On the Google map, I read the town’s name was Colonia. </p><p>“What to do and see there?”, I asked.</p><p>“There are lots of colorful windows and beautiful houses. It’s a prefect place for walking around and relax. I was there for 3 days and loved it!”, she excitedly replied.</p><p>OK, a town with colorful windows, I had that as my first impression of Colonia. Since I had plenty of time before my flight to Iguazu and it is so close to Buenos Aires, I decided to visit the town.</p><p>Upon checking in my hostel in Colonia, I started my “Colorful Window Hunt” in Colonia’s historic quarter. The gateway to the historic quarter is a drawbridge called <strong>Puerta de la Ciudadela</strong>, leading into what used to be a fortress. </p><p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14vQuzp5nDVpbWkCSDSFaX7EVsud7GxqE">s</p><p>So I found myself walking on the cobblestone streets and surrounded by colorful colonial houses.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Y1yUYpnYJ5KirW3IgsjZjOmuwpsZ7vw4"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18kJBRgF0sIVJqg8NmpKUy816-C5yYVVc"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wYDTOotzMh90AOVjXyGy_XB57umbA455"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1U3-S0gY-MlpagQwZ0MORwPoHcqfQ9Mi8"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gGpjKUGP3wpMGwh7H5yVf6zikooiNN3h"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1j0HfOGU_Mzw7qmwM4xj0osKNmV0Rs1mw"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pJ7Md_YUXs-1ItzggaWJjPNcW3ACVUUJ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=17FZGiOgcjDQPZJCZKVAuBsDaOJlZh50U"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1378HDGSaJdEbcl4VqCxpx8osgcAPOBNi"><p><strong>Colonia del Sacramento lighthouse</strong> is the one of the most important landmark in Colonia.

Besides the cobblestone streets and colorful colonial houses, it has many hiden gems for one to explore.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=176dWH7EnL24rk8XlpOQnWt9vdwEvc4o5"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1U0vnVeWYXFxScv054YQwhwdPqy2owGAx"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1P54VqIbADfvKzAUQ8q1Mkge5zbS9ZD8H"><p>However, one needs only a couple of hours to navigate all of Colonia’s historic quarter. Being an active solo backpacker, I got bored of the town very quickly. </p><p>Yes, there are plenty of restuarants and bars. But no matter how good the Uruguayan beers are, as a solo backpacker, how much time I could kill at a bar? After two beers at ‘the best local brew pub in town’, I left the bar and ready for dinner.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZC0YwydhJgoevWW5aBrDCUmWCTrxm-lX"><p>As night came, I found there was nothing to do?! I chatted with the hostel recieption and asked for recommendations on what to do for the night. “People come here for drinking and partying with their friends. As you are alone, it is really difficult for you to find anything to do…” That was the pitty response I got from the recieption?! But he also suggested maybe I could take a walk back to the historic quarter or walk along the beach. Guess what I did both and found neither of the two was worth spending my time and engery. </p><p>I returned to my hostel and had no option but to order another Uruguayan beer  to kill my time in my hostel’s garden… OK, third beer of the day and see how bored I was. You may ask why not I went to sleep or just relax in Colonia. Did you noticed two keywords from the recieption’s response? Drinking and Partying. Unfortunately, I picked a party hostel, my bad…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18b1iJGwA2k2m17bo2WHN1GknhmCi1EkN"><p>Originally, I was planning to stay for 3 days in Colonia. But there was really nothing to do alone, maybe it would be different if you come with friends, families, and/or your loved one. Also, I did not like my hostel. So I returned to Buenos Aires the very next morning!</p><h1 id="How-to-get-to-Colonia-del-Sacramento"><a href="#How-to-get-to-Colonia-del-Sacramento" class="headerlink" title="How to get to Colonia del Sacramento"></a><strong>How to get to Colonia del Sacramento</strong></h1><p>The Buenos Aires Colonia del Sacramento ferry route connects Argentina with Uruguay and was operated by 2 ferry companies, <a href="https://www.buquebus.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Buquebus</a> and <a href="https://www.coloniaexpress.com/ar" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Colonia Express</a>.  The navigation time is the same, around 1 hour 15 minutes no matter which company you choose.</p><p>I took the Buquesbus to Colonia and Colonia Express back to BA. The main difference between the two ferry companies are the price and harbor locations in Buenos Aires. The Colonia Express was half of the price of the Buquesbus ferry (27.37 USD vs 50.93 USD). Also, Colonia Express’s harbor was a little bit difficult to get to by public transit while the Buquebus’s harbor is conveniently located close to downtown and metro stations. But both ferry companies use the same harbor in Colonia, Uruguay.</p><p>To be fair, the Buquebus’s ferry is much better than the one from Colonia Express. It is a very large ferry or you can call it a boat. The ride was so smooth that I did not even notice that the ferry was on the move and left the harbor. I thought we were delayed! The Buquebus ferry has a two-level walk-in Duty Free shop and a cafe serving food and drinks. The seating is generally airplane style and spacious, and there is a lot of room to store personal belongings. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ai6gzf6UrToVe1ZUWPjj-UKdX96V8AYR"><p>Considering Colonia Express is much cheaper than the Buquebus and the total travel time is only about an hour, I do not have too much complain about its ferry and somewhat bumpy ride. Colonia Express also has a Duty-Free shop on the ferry, just smaller. All in All, I was very satisfied with Colonia Express.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ydqqb-XiunoB40j4xqDU6p6zBC18s2SQ"><h1 id="Food-in-Colonia"><a href="#Food-in-Colonia" class="headerlink" title="Food in Colonia"></a>Food in Colonia</h1><p>For my short stay in Colonia, I only tried one restaurant, <strong>Parrillada El Portón</strong>, which is one block away from my hostel. This is a tourist restaurant, the taste was just OK but surprisingly it was reasonably priced. For take out orders, it even provide 25-30% discount. Based on my personal taste, still Argentina wins! Unfortunately, I did not visit Brazil.

A chivito sandwich – which translates “little goat” in English – actually has no goat meat in it, yet it is still incredibly delicious and hearty. The sandwich is filled with meat - slices of <em>churrasco</em> (grilled/roasted and thinly sliced beef), ham, bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, melted mozzarella, and a topping of fried eggs.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11wVaAHM0DTN5DymZ3CS5QlwV0WAMs-Gh"><p>For dinner, I decided to try the <strong>Uruguayan barbeque</strong>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Buenos Aires is the capital city of Argentina and is one of the largest cities in South America. Locals  like to claim that their city really is the ‘Paris of the South’. The city has a long seafaring history and was influenced by Spanish colonisers, British capitalists and Italian immigrants, creating a vibrant mix of architecture, food and culture. With a great climate, friendly people, tasty food and for a very reasonable price. Buenos Aires is truly a world-class city. Plus, its public transit system is the best in South America (even better than many of the cities in the States) and the only city I visited where Google Transit works!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bTTaR3qdhVf4i3-qWrq28xOWEVoW2yIR"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Buenos-Aires-First-Impression"><a href="#Buenos-Aires-First-Impression" class="headerlink" title="Buenos Aires - First Impression"></a>Buenos Aires - First Impression</h1><p>I arrived at Buenos Aires at 5 p.m. I did mention that surprisingly Google Transit works in Buenos Aires. With that, I decided to take a direct bus from the airport to my hostel. Friends, do remember to purchase a transit card. Mine was purchased in Ushuaia and works in Buenos Aires as well. </p><p>It was a little bit crazy to carry all my huge backpacks in an  extremely crowded bus during the peak hour. But I managed to find my temporal home in the city, Selina! Yes, after 2-month, I finally arrived at a city where Selina operates! Again, BA Selina locates Palermo Soho, a trendy neighborhood in Buenos Aires home to cocktail bars, sizzling Argentinian grills, and plenty of culture. There I was, at a huge bus stop (with probably over 10-15 bus lines stopping there) at Plaza Italia. I walked on the tree-lined street and instantly fell in love with this area!</p><p>My first night at BA spent on visiting laundry store, stocking food and drinks for my stay in supermarket and lastly hunting for  dinner! There were plenty of fancy restaurants in the area. But I was filled with Argentinean grills in Calafate and Chalten, so I went to an Asian restaurant. It was decorated as Asian street food court, with Japanese, Korean and Chinese menu. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11IJ-G3AdnDiT6A5Y38o0wrQ1rehgb4aI"><p>I was so hungry so I had one appetizer and two entrees…I guess the waiter was a little bit shocked. This was my table, Korean bulgogi rice bowl, Taiwanese braised beef noodle and fried dumplings! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1N2tQHWK4ePT0N-yllSe4QdJaZHryPJeP"><p>That night was ended with a cocktail at Selina’s rooftop bar! What a prefect ending for the day!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12uQkNn8mBMZGRLzzyG_QKeXmabTy5Hiv"><h1 id="Tour-in-BA’s-Downtown"><a href="#Tour-in-BA’s-Downtown" class="headerlink" title="Tour in BA’s Downtown"></a>Tour in BA’s Downtown</h1><p>The next day, I took the subway to visit BA’s downtown area. Here, I really need to emphasize that the public transit system in BA is really GREAT and very cheap (around 20 ARS per ride for buses and metro).</p><p>So first, was the icon of Buenos Aires, <strong>the Obelisk</strong>! The main street, Av. 9 de Julio has?!  The wide road in the photo was Avenida 9 de Julio. It has  more than 12 lanes and is the world’s widest street!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bTTaR3qdhVf4i3-qWrq28xOWEVoW2yIR"><p>Street view of BA’s downtown.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_Cf3sFeeHl90hAIwV3_OE-3qRTc60vk_"><p>I was walking on the street and passed by a Starbuck. All of sudden, I remembered a backpacker I met in Ushuaia told me that she had the cheapest Starbuck coffee in BA. To check out the price, I had my only Starbuck’s coffee in South America. Grande dark roast for 140 ARS (~ 2.35 USD). I think it’s cheaper in the States. But having a cup of coffee in the morning and watching busy people passing by was proved to be a very pleasant morning rest!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MdZcNr1KWW0mkbgTPTs421n5xToBbG8y"><p>Then I visited <strong>Metropolitan Cathedral</strong>, where Mausoleum of General San Martín was placed.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pB9wwspiKtO0jj7Ox4f_RSIGloLdDiqi"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YhbxuBDAs59z0g0Q4tcRd9s-g-iu8vny"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HZNJzGjGA8WPRmlXxlv2rVwBKQR0ubFG"><p>Next stop was the <strong><em>Casa Rosada</em></strong> (the Pink House). The Pink House, like the White House in the U.S. is the executive mansion and office of the President of Argentina. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QZVfxhE8Z0m2xm2bV4myCeEUX_nSc5YC"><p>Located close to the city center, <strong>Puerto Madero</strong>, a  redeveloped port area is well worth a visit to walk along the river. There were many bars and restaurants for having a leisurely meal or some refreshments.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10cQIzmV6G_mBluA5eon7qAJ3v3skwDbu"><p>Another tourist attraction in BA’s downtown is <strong>Calle Florida</strong>. This shopping street is only open to pedestrians. Florida Street is perfect for those scrambling to pick up some last minute traditional touristy gifts such as football jerseys, shot glasses, mate sets and Taiwanese tango figurines. There are also leather goods on sale. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EAY-PLwr5Emm_sYvkh1tG3Uh7QIiqKao"><p>Last note on <strong>Calle Florida</strong>, there will be plenty of brokers calling out “Cambio! Cambio!”. You may consider to exchange with somebody there. Their exchange rates were much better than from the banks! At that time, my Chase bank’s exchange rate was approximately 60 ARS for 1 U.S. dollar. On that street, I got 68 ARS for 1 U.S. dollar. But that was the rate for over 100 U.S dollars. </p><h1 id="Tour-of-Theaters"><a href="#Tour-of-Theaters" class="headerlink" title="Tour of Theaters"></a>Tour of Theaters</h1><h2 id="Colon-Theatre"><a href="#Colon-Theatre" class="headerlink" title="Colón Theatre"></a>Colón Theatre</h2><blockquote><p>The <strong>Teatro Colon</strong>, in the City of Buenos Aires, is considered one of the best theaters in the world.

The discount cost for early morning and late afternoon tour was 800 ARS (~ 15 USD).

Colorful shanty houses line each side of the street and impromptu performances are often carried out by talented tango dancers.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1D0pODZuNbNq9sQ9m1PufGKSMKEJ9wye-"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YcnLD9ZufzWpObr7_eVVJ_gLqUyPBXiB"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1d2Ixaqs371WXQnWp1-jYoH1LQiWeQjcp"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1C4bE6DmseWmRz60OR-JlLniarxs4_8te"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1eO_qVq3Lt8qhEJ_eXHyx4dheCDw0PDZy"><p>This tiny neighborhood was nice to visit. However, it is a really TINY area. I guess the alley is about 100 meters in length. If you were alone and not planning to have some refreshment or meals there, it would take you at most 1 hour for touring the area.</p><h1 id="Food-in-Buenos-Aires"><a href="#Food-in-Buenos-Aires" class="headerlink" title="Food in Buenos Aires"></a>Food in Buenos Aires</h1><p>First, the only non-Asian meal in BA for my first stay. </p><p>Paella with one beef empanada for 560 ARS (~ 10 USD)</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13cxk6u3f-fBizGBAC08ZwuWGmOjoAYIL"><p>Then some Asian restaurants checks around my hostel in Palermo.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1N2tQHWK4ePT0N-yllSe4QdJaZHryPJeP"><p>And the following was from the BEST Chinese restaurant (<strong>Beijing Restaurant</strong>) I have tried in South America.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I was in southern Patagonia, Torres del Paine National Park in Chile and Argentina’s Los Glaciares National Park are the region’s top highlights. After completed my hiking adventures in Paine, Chile, I continued my exploration to the Argentinean Patagonia region searching for more dramatic natural wonders like Perito Moreno Glacier in El Calafate and Mount Fitz Roy in El Chalten. For stingy backpackers, Patagonia from the Argentinean side is as stunning as from the Chilean side, but costs much cheaper. I was recommended by not one but many backpackers I met on the way to skip the expensive Paine but directly venture to Argentinean side of Patagonia. I did not regret visiting Paine but Argentinean food is so much better than Chilean food for sure!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Xaz7CBOgGYdY4uKTbrBvVQxH9bjPG2CJ"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="My-Happy-Return-to-Argentinean-Embrace"><a href="#My-Happy-Return-to-Argentinean-Embrace" class="headerlink" title="My Happy Return to Argentinean Embrace"></a>My Happy Return to Argentinean Embrace</h1><p> I escaped Puerto Natales right after I was done with Paine. I did not like Puerto Natales, maybe due to its daily rain with grey sky or maybe due to my my never-satisfied empty stomach with my wobbly legs. Approximately 170 miles north of Puerto Natales, there is El Calafate, a southern Argentinean town and the base for Los Glaciares National Park. Just after a 5-hour bus ride, I returned to the embrace of Argentinean meat heaven! I might be biased and don’t get offended, my Chilean friends. That is totally my personal preference, but I do like Argentina and Argentinean food (mostly their meat…) very much! </p><p>I did not have hostel reservation in El Calafate by the time I arrived the town. Hey, that was called dynamic/real time planning and the beauty of solo backpacking! No plan nor reservation needed! So I stopped by at a hostel next to the bus terminal. Unfortunately, that hostel was fully booked that day. But I had a nice chat with their front desk. The guy not only recommended me another nearby hostel but also kind of ‘forced’ me to try the BEST restaurant in town. Yes, after I told him I was starving in Chile and wanted to have a good dinner for the night. He took the phone and made a reservation for me. That was even before my Googling for the restaurant to confirm that I would like to go there for dinner. Yes, without my confirmation, he called in at around 5 p.m. Later he told me that this restaurant is so popular in town that making reservation at 5 pm for the same-day dinner was already too late?! Well, I guessed that I had no options but to go there for my dinner that night.</p><p>Before my dinner, I stopped by a grocery shop for stocking my life liquid, Coke Cola. There I met the customer service cat in the veggie section! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=17WaX2avCVG-58B0B03KUiA1dS0sei94r"><p>It was near dusk, with the sky growing dark in the distance and refreshing breeze in the air. I was delightfully walking down the street to one of the best restaurants in El Calafate. All these made me happy! Shortly, I was at <a href="https://isabelcocinaaldisco.com/en/index.php/inicio/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Isabel Cocina al Disco</a>, the chic and popular restaurant. The guy was right. The restaurant was full and without reservation you have to wait for your table for at least half an hour.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AlVOuGBJooG0-eKHLAwhB29kqjzyjxFq"><p>It was a chic and fancy restaurant, with great service and atmosphere. Most of the customers were well dressed again, I felt a little bit embarrassed with my ‘greyish’ outdoor outfits there. But I was used to this feeling. I ordered their local specialty on the menu, the ‘lamb plough’. It is like a stew dish with Patagonian lamb in a casted iron pot. The taste was great with one complain. This restaurant is NOT single-person friendly. So the specialty item ‘the plough’ on the menu is meant and priced for sharing by two-person. For single/solo customers, you can order for half the plough but needed to pay 70% of the price?! Being the pathetic solo backpacker, I had to choose either to order some ‘ordinary’ dishes or to pay for a little bit unfair price for the plough for myself. Plough was so attracting so I surrendered. But the portion for one-person was still very large and I could not finish it. Yes, even me could not finish… A one-person plough with a glass of house Malbec costed 1280 ARS (~ 22 USD). I was very satisfied but I did not return to this restaurant for its solo customer unfriendly menu. There are plenty of good restaurants in el Calafate.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1c0fSF_oTvesDrIry8FcL7KQa_tVZ3B1T"><h1 id="Stunning-Glaciers-Lots-and-Lots-of-Them"><a href="#Stunning-Glaciers-Lots-and-Lots-of-Them" class="headerlink" title="Stunning Glaciers - Lots and Lots of Them"></a>Stunning Glaciers - Lots and Lots of Them</h1><p>El Calafate is an important base for one of Argentina’s most impressive national parks, <strong>Los Glaciares</strong>. By this statement, I guess you are clear why I was there, for the glaciers of course! I was very impressed by <strong>Glacier Grey</strong> in Torres del Paine National Park. However, visiting Glacier Grey is not an easy task. It is part of W-trek in Paine. Although a day-hike to Glacier Grey is possible, it would be a long and exhausting day. Another option is to take an expensive 3-hour boat tour for 80 USD. If you want to see glaciers, El Calafate is probably the best place in South America or even the one of the best places in the world!</p><h2 id="Perito-Moreno-Glacier"><a href="#Perito-Moreno-Glacier" class="headerlink" title="Perito Moreno Glacier"></a>Perito Moreno Glacier</h2><p>Perito Moreno covers an area of 250 square kilometers, is 5 kilometers wide, 30 kilometers long and when the highest point of the glacier reaches more than 70 meters, two-thirds are still below the water level and cannot be seen!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Xaz7CBOgGYdY4uKTbrBvVQxH9bjPG2CJ"><p>Due to its size, accessibility and well built infrastructure, <strong>Perito Moreno Glacier</strong> is one of the major tourist attractions in southern Patagonia. It locates only 80 km away from El Calafate and there are lots of bus companies taking you there from the town. </p><p>There are viewing platforms a safe distance from the glacier, overlooking Lake Argentino, the glacier’s terminus. You can get pretty close—to the point that you can basically feeling the glacier breathing cold air on your face. The viewing platforms are very well built and there are ramps and even an elevator for wheelchairs. <strong>Perito Moreno is the most friendly glacier for people at all ages and physical condition in my opinion.</strong> </p><p>Check out the walking and view platforms. For the entire park, every inch of the walking platform was well built and one never need to step on loose gravel trek! This hiking/walking condition really surprised me! I was so used to walk on dusty loose gravel, rocky hash mountains or muddy terrains. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EpSbHSfgeA_DI92lsSDj52626o_SLVQ0"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1o52EhZv51L_WT3KvtYLawKNsXcDiS8lB"><p>It is impossible to fully appreciate Perito Moreno Glacier until you will physically stand in front of its face overlooking it across Lago Argentino. Perito Moreno Glacier in photos do not do the justice to show its stunning beauty! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1B7B4Hw0C-l1UwW8fXx_J4dRbCeq9Ere_"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ofKs-aaucj_sPKnkgbTU7BfYXCeNK281"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IstWheJBjkbBlIwbYJADUBx9bnQDibhd"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GyaXhiKl4MYRHccZBF3Y7Qa4-suPcbF6"><p><strong>Walking Around the Perito Moreno Glacier</strong></p><p>Again, the entire walking platform is well built. There were several treks for travelers to view the glacier at different angles. But one can easily complete all trails inside the park. The total lengths for all trails is just about 4 km and again one a flat platform!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1swnpobjFdnvqCMTDSQ8NtEVEfXdpT7pg"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1PRzCBANnc3KtOsWWvDGdJsHXSFoCH-UN"><p><strong>Extra Information</strong></p><ul><li>Inside the park, there you can find a 1-hour short boat navigation. </li><li>If your budget allows, you can actually do an ice-trekking in Perito Moreno. This will cost you around 130 - 200 USD depending on the tour you pick. <strong><a href="https://hieloyaventura.com/en/home/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hielo y Aventura S.A.</a></strong> is the only company who can operate the ice-trekking tours in Perito Moreno. They have office locations in El Calafate. </li><li>Los Glaciers Park entrance ticket cost 800 ARS (~ 13 USD) and you can get a 50% discount for the second day visit. </li></ul><p><strong>My Total Cost for Visiting Perito Moreno Glacier</strong></p><ul><li>Round Bus Ticket: 1000 ARS (~ 17 USD)</li><li>Los Glaciers Park Entrance Ticket: 1200 ARS (~ 20 USD) good for two-day. One-day ticket is only 800 ARS (~ 13 USD)</li></ul><h2 id="Glacier-Cruise-Tour"><a href="#Glacier-Cruise-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Glacier Cruise Tour"></a>Glacier Cruise Tour</h2><p>Again, there are plenty of tour agencies lined up in the main street of El Calafate. You won’t miss that street. The town is very small and almost everything is clustered around the main street. After I shopped around, I decided to go with the most expensive option, <a href="http://www.crucerosmarpatag.com/en/glaciers-experience/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Maria Turquesa Cruise</strong></a> for a full-day glacier touring experience. This cruise tour was very expensive. I shopped around and finally sealed a deal with one of the tour agency by paying US dollars in cash and purchased my round trip bus ticket to El Chalten with them. The total cost was approximately 120 USD for this cruise tour! What I was thinking at that time for paying this much of money just for a one-day cruise?!</p><p>However, honestly, it was a luxury cruise with lunch provided although just a sandwich…Also with this cruise, you would visit three glaciers, Spegazzini Glacier, Upsala Glacier, Perito Moreno Glacier and have the opportunity view lots of beautiful floating icebergs. But still, I will leave the decision to you to see if it is worth paying for this high price. Note that except for Perito Moreno Glacier, all other glaciers are not accessible by road. The only way to view them is by boat…</p><p>Our luxury cruise at the dock waiting for us at around 9 a.m.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FN-OgVg95vXQ0qf4kmnHsosu3YodSDE8"><p>Up close to Spegazzini Glacier!

While there was not much to see on this mini trek, but you can have a chance to enjoy the view of peaceful Lago Argentino with its distinctive milky blue water color.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QgXFuKcgrDSmcTewDL5BLlJ4mLMt6ORK"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FvJfeKLrsy884WhGk2x0m1EvDTJ87uOl"><p>Then we had a chance to see the largest glacier in South America,<strong>Upsala Glacier</strong>. It is <strong>336-sq.miles (870km²) in area, almost three times the size of New York city!</strong>  Known for the extensive calving of ice at its foot, Upsala Glacier has actually been mostly inaccessible since 2008, when a series of huge icebergs calved into Lake Argentino, blocking the approach to the glacier. There is navigation limit set by the park and our cruise could not sail close to it. So here is the panoramic view of the largest glacier in South America. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1kH_aymriVgPZcxX23KTk3_d_hqK0qglL"><p>Although we could not have a clear view of <strong>Upsala Glacier</strong>, it is your best opportunity to see icebergs in Upsala Canal. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13hbiWs4mDHPcQk9-ELmenpsDcnjT-eiL"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nueIiE7vHHmnT4ZNvn3lrXO8V4jPV58v"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1REe7ueDSNIwwpocLFdeM8o33CNu94QmE"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1kGJNnHs6wYhlmINm457lVwf4Vd0e0H19"><p>In this iceberg dotted area, the crew brought some iceberg from the water for us to take pictures and feel.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OoYZnVH0QbBRGPxJ4M_y4CNybGXokInP"><p>Small ice cubes are not blue but transparent. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1u5kNkEOZ7FSHQnHcGnM3rrGCpWoUzy9b"><p>I think this is the right moment to put some scientific (boring) information about glaciers.</p><div class="note info">            <p><strong>Formation</strong></p><p>Glaciers begin to form when snow remains in the same area year-round, where enough snow accumulates to transform into ice. Each year, new layers of snow bury and compress the previous layers. This compression forces the snow to re-crystallize, forming grains similar in size and shape to grains of sugar. Gradually the grains grow larger and the air pockets between the grains get smaller, causing the snow to slowly compact and increase in density. After about a year, the snow turns into firn—an intermediate state between snow and glacier ice. At this point, it is about two-thirds as dense as water. Over time, larger ice crystals become so compressed that any air pockets between them are very tiny. In very old glacier ice, crystals can reach several inches in length. For most glaciers, this process takes more than a hundred years.</p><p><strong>Why Blue?</strong></p><p>Snow is white because full spectrum, or white, light is scattered and reflected at the boundary between ice and air. The white color of bubbles at the top of a dark beer work the same way—small pockets of air reflect and scatter visible light. Ice only appears blue when it is sufficiently consolidated that bubbles do not interfere with the passage of light. Without the scattering effect of air bubbles, light can penetrate ice undisturbed. In ice, the absorption of light at the red end of the spectrum is six times greater than at the blue end. Thus the deeper light energy travels, the more photons from the red end of the spectrum it loses along the way. Two meters into the glacier, most of the reds are dead. A lack of reflected red wavelengths produces the color blue in the human eye.</p>          </div><p>All above was what I Googled from the internet after my glacier cruise tour. But on the cruise I had one of my dream realized, to taste the glacier! Ideally, I should have had it with whiskey, but coke was also great. This is my lunch, a sandwich, some fries and ice from glacier with Coke Zero! The ice cube is probably hundreds years old and maybe it was just my feeling, it did taste a little different from the normal ice cube with a hint of metallic taste.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SLT4InZiMA1Ew6zFxunO-jKXbZtqjPeZ"><p>Why whiskey with iceberg? It was for Chivas Regal Commercial from 12 years ago! Why do I remember that commercial for such a long time?  Check it out. Although the video quality is terrible from YouTube, this commercial  is still so great in 2020. By the way, the song is Mermaid Song by Sarah Khider.</p><iframe width="525" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhJolSHG-UE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In the afternoon, we sailed to Perito Moreno Glacier. So If you also plan to have a full day glacier cruise tour, you don’t need to do the navigation tour when you visit Perito Moreno Glacier.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yWDSrCYevlwD17fFD7r4o6IUQAryfE8r"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1h_NNNOPk_z7eQDLAQu65Q-9THUTfGj6K"><p>It was a full day tour. By the time I returned to downtown El Calafate, it was almost 6 p.m.</p><h1 id="El-Chalten-The-Capital-of-Trekking"><a href="#El-Chalten-The-Capital-of-Trekking" class="headerlink" title="El Chalten - The Capital of Trekking"></a>El Chalten - The Capital of Trekking</h1><p>With 3-hour’s bus ride from El Calafate, I arrived El Chalten, the capital of trekking. Maybe due to my exhausting hiking in Paine or my non-stop glacier tours in El Calafate, I was feeling a little bit sick by that day and slept on the bus for 99% of the time. I was waken up by screams and camera shutter sound in the bus later. And this was the picture I took from the bus, stunning view!!!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-6L9GWJjmtwjbwkHB2IQ2hsoWA4oIagH"><p>For those who don’t know, the famous outdoor brand Patagonia’s logo is actually the skyline of the Cerro Fitz Roy (the Fitzroy Massif) in Patagonia, above El Chaltén! </p><p>Unfortunately, I only had 2 full-day time in El Chalten. Yes, even being a solo backpacker, I still had some flight reservation made couple days ago to Buenos Aires. If I were there again, I would definitely stay there for more days. The people in El Chalten were so tough and to them hiking is the only thing to do in the town. Below was the conversation I had with the reception of my hostel in El Chalten on my first day arrival.</p><p>Lan: “Hello, I’d like to check in and this is my reservation information. I am a little bit sick. So if possible, please give me a quieter dorm. Thank you!”</p><p>The reception: “Let me look into it.”</p><p>Lan (after the check in): “I have 2 days in El Chalten. Do you have any suggestions on what to do here?”</p><p>The reception: “OK, it is still early today and you can finish a short hike to the water fall, Cascada Margarita. It is an easy hike and only takes about 2-3 hours. Tomorrow, you can finish the Fitz Roy and for the third day, you can choose a day hike like to Laguna Torre. “</p><p>Lan: “Did I mention that I am sick? Is that too much?”</p><p>The reception: “Come on, you are in El Chalten, the capital of trekking! What else you should do here?!”</p><p>Lan: “OK, I guess I have no choice but to hike…”</p><p>But I did not hike to Cascada Margarita that late afternoon. It was almost 4 pm by the time I checked in. And I was really exhausted. To prepare myself for tomorrow’s assignment, the Fitz Roy, I decided to go for a hunt for dinner and have a good rest for the day.</p><div class="note info">            <h4 id="The-Capital-of-Hiking-and-That-is-TRUE"><a href="#The-Capital-of-Hiking-and-That-is-TRUE" class="headerlink" title="The Capital of Hiking and That is TRUE!!!"></a>The Capital of Hiking and That is TRUE!!!</h4><p>One fact is that hiking in el Chalten is completely free and all trails begin directly from el Chalten while entrance ticket for Torres del Paine National Park costs 21,000 CL) (~ 27 USD) and the park locates 2-hour bus ride away from Puerto Natales. Almost every trail begins directly from the town of El Chalten!</p>          </div><h2 id="Conquer-Fitz-Roy"><a href="#Conquer-Fitz-Roy" class="headerlink" title="Conquer Fitz Roy"></a>Conquer Fitz Roy</h2><p>The weather in Patagonia is so unpredictable. It may start to rain at anytime. Fortunately, my second day in El Chalten was a no-rain day! So although I was not feeling well, I decided to conquer Fitz Roy trek that day with the sentence “What else can you do in Chalten?” echoing in my brain.</p><p>Here I was at the start of the Fitz Roy trail head. Sigh, there was 23 km more to go…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FWNU3HWd5u55DkCRMOwZpo_dsKKy--Wk"><p>The start of the Fitz Roy day hike was completely an uphill battle. The start was quite steep but it becomes flatter (but still uphill) after the first km. For this part, you will come across nice views of the valley.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16U5SmxPGevAqw5Pf9_qq8CosxFj3baTA"><p>Continued on the trek, you will come across a view point to see the Fitz Roy the first time on this hike around Kilometer 3. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16PeY5qIGZkOGwN51Oc_1weB3MHg0_6A9"><p>For the next 5-6 km, the terrain is mostly flat.

I took my lunch break there before the most challenging part of the trek for the day. The last part of the trail before you reach the base of Fitz Roy is only 1 km. Sound easy right? No, the elevation gain for this part is over 400 meters! You can imagine how steep it gets. What is worse? This part of the hike is the on loose gravels for the first half part then on small pebbles for the second part. </p><p>So the trail uphill to Fitz Roy is this?! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Y-9qlt6MMgVoxpvi3U7Q-S3ute3KUsLM"><p>Up, up and up!

I was in El Chalten in early December for a total stay of three days. It rained for two days. Actually, I only did one hike on the second day. The third day was raining heavily. Originally, I was planning to do one more hike on day 3. Due to the weather, I took a bus back to El Chalten one day earlier. Since there was nothing to do in Chalten on a rainy day, remember, hiking is the only thing here! Yes, I met people waited in hostel for days until sun come out for hike to Fitz Roy.</li><li>Ice Trek on Cagliero Glacier! It was a full day activity, combined with hiking, ROCK CLIMBING and ice trekking on the glacier. It was a lot more than ice trekking on Piete Moreno and much cheaper for about 150 USD!!! I highly recommend you do this. I was so tempted to join this tour. But for my short stay in El Chalten, I only had one non rainy day and that was for Fitz Roy.

      &lt;p&gt;So I was in southern Patagonia, Torres del Paine National Park in Chile and Argentina’s Los Glaciares National Park are the region’s top highlights. After completed my hiking adventures in Paine, Chile, I continued my exploration to the Argentinean Patagonia region searching for more dramatic natural wonders like Perito Moreno Glacier in El Calafate and Mount Fitz Roy in El Chalten. For stingy backpackers, Patagonia from the Argentinean side is as stunning as from the Chilean side, but costs much cheaper. I was recommended by not one but many backpackers I met on the way to skip the expensive Paine but directly venture to Argentinean side of Patagonia. I did not regret visiting Paine but Argentinean food is so much better than Chilean food for sure!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever heard of Patagonia (No, not the famous outdoor brand)? Patagonia has a fixed spot on the list of <strong>the most amazing hiking areas in the world</strong>! This GRANDE region shared by Argentina and Chile displays some of the most thrilling natural sceneries on the planet. Of all of them, Chile’s <strong>Torres del Paine</strong> may be the most attractive. Hiking in Torres del Paine was on the bucket list of almost every backpackers I met in South America. For my personal record, I hiked three days in a row with a total distance of over 65 km in Torres del Paine National Park. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ii7ci6uytiESi5yixPE7URedcRwRfudi"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Getting-to-Puerto-Natales-Another-LONG-Cross-Country-Bus-Ride"><a href="#Getting-to-Puerto-Natales-Another-LONG-Cross-Country-Bus-Ride" class="headerlink" title="Getting to Puerto Natales - Another LONG Cross Country Bus Ride"></a>Getting to Puerto Natales - Another LONG Cross Country Bus Ride</h1><p>From Ushuaia, I got an early morning (7 a.m.) bus to Punta Arena, Chile. This took 11 hours including a  including a ferry trip across the Magellan Straits at its narrowest point. By the way, for those who do not know, Ushuaia is located on <strong>Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego</strong> (<em>Big Island of the Land of Fire</em>), the largest island in South America and shared by Chile and Argentina. I was sleeping on the bus for most of the time, only waken by the driver when we stopped at the border control point and the ferry transfer harbor. My experience of first Chilean border crossing from Bolivia was not good. Each and every bag of the passengers was opened and hand checked that time. It took almost an hour for our bus to pass the control point that time. But this one turned out to be an seamlessly fast and easy process. While having our passport stamped, there were border patrol dogs sniffing the bus’s luggage trunk. Yes, we did not even need to unload our backpacks this time! </p><p>Then our bus stopped again at Strait of Magellan for our ferry back to South American’s mainland. The colors and views at the strait were so stunning and I considered it to be a tourist spot for my bus ride!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AlCYc3Ctn0oBgp4NUlX-2ufwt-efwnkw"><p>The beautiful shades of blue with a lovely red and white luxury ferry (No, this was not the ferry for our bus, unfortunately) at the strait. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wUaDnRreSCi_w3QZDwO_Xx8YEZCcZeS8"><p>What we got was this one, a barge…Do you see any indoor places, not even a seat? So all the passengers and bus/truck drivers were crowdedly standing a narrow second level deck. Weather was sunny and the colors of the sea and blue sky were wonderful. I started to enjoy the views with fresh air. After five minutes’ standing in the furious winds, I started to hoping our ferry trip would end as soon as possible! I could not bear it longer!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tmqLQ3wP2xp0_C8oSLD_dSnkHtKwFbVx"><p>As soon as we reached the land, I quickly run back to our warm bus and return to sleep. Yeah, I was trained to sleep on the buses comfortably with my eye mask after three months’ backpacking. Nothing would bother me from my sound and sweet sleep on buses. Sometimes, the sleeping quality was even higher than in the dorms with ‘not so quite’ roommates. </p><p>At around 18:00, our bus arrived Punta Arena. Some people may consider to stay at Punta Arena for couple of days. My mind was all set for hiking in Paine. So I decided to continue my bus ride to Puerto Natales. There are several bus companies serve the route between Punta Arenas and Puerto Natales. Luckily, the drop off point was very close to one of them, <strong><a href="http://www.busesfernandez.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buses Fernández</a></strong> with very frequent buses to Puerto Natales with last bus departing at 21:00. I got a bus ticket at 19:15! No time for a real dinner, so I only had two not so tasty empanadas from a small shop near the bus terminal. Thank god, I slept most of the day on the bus so the energy consumption was not that high. </p><p>Finally, I made it to Puerto Natales at midnight. A budget backpacker like me always wanted to save money and seldom took a taxi. But I was so exhausted and it was raining and dark. I walked out the terminal and decided to take a taxi to my hostel. Surprisingly, there was not a line of taxi waiting, not even ONE?! OK, everyone come here for hiking. I got this. Backpackers live on their foot! It should be a piece of cake to walk only 2 KM with your huge backpack to the hostel. You were in a town with mostly flat and paved streets. Although it was midnight, you got some dimmed lights from sparse streetlights. It was rainy but not snow or even hail. This was a pre-test for Paine.  <strong>This day set my Chilean hiking tone in Paine, always exhausted and starving!</strong></p><h1 id="Hiking-in-Torres-del-Paine"><a href="#Hiking-in-Torres-del-Paine" class="headerlink" title="Hiking in Torres del Paine"></a>Hiking in Torres del Paine</h1><p>Well, people come to <strong>Puerto Natales</strong> for one and only one thing, to hike in Torres del Paine National Park. It is continuously written and talked about as one of the greatest places in the world for trekking. While there are a few people come just for day hikes or a bus tour which are totally fine and even day hikes are not that easy but moderate to <strong>strenuous</strong> trails. I came all the way to Puerto Natales, definitely not here for only conquering one or two ‘short and easy’ trails. </p><h2 id="Hiking-Routes-in-the-Park"><a href="#Hiking-Routes-in-the-Park" class="headerlink" title="Hiking Routes in the Park"></a>Hiking Routes in the Park</h2><p>There are probably 40+ trails in the park from easy 2-4 hours walk to strenuous multiday backcountry trekking.</p><p>For a quick overview of the options, I found the following information from <a href="https://stingynomads.com/torres-del-paine-hiking-guide/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stingy Nomads</a>. You can use their complete guide as a start of your hiking plan. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HbsGdmnPXLhAmhIgb2JFd3kQCkOZJe_Q"><ul><li>Day hikes: as I said before, there are many day-hiking trails in the park, dinstance between 5-20 km.</li><li>W-trek: probably the most popular and well-known trek in Paine! It is about 100 km and need 3-5 days to complete.</li><li>O-trek: if you’re a serious hiker ready to tackle the backcountry for up to 7+ days, then this option is the choice. The “W” is part of the full circuit.</li><li>Q-trek: is an even more <strong>ambitious way of discovering the varied landscapes and breathtaking beauty</strong> of this famed national park. </li></ul><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GiCGm-0NTRA9Vfz3jFUFAwFEHX-mgPzT"><h2 id="Planning-for-Your-Hiking-Trip"><a href="#Planning-for-Your-Hiking-Trip" class="headerlink" title="Planning for Your Hiking Trip"></a>Planning for Your Hiking Trip</h2><p>Planning for multiday trekking in Torres del Paine National Park is not an easy task! You need to carefully plan for your stayover places, rent/bring your camping gears (backpack, tent, sleeping bags, gas stove etc.) and your food supplies! There are lots of shops offering camp gear renting services in Puerto Natales if you want to do so. Also there are plenty sleeping options inside the park from ‘luxury’ refugios to very basic campsites. However, <strong>those are operated by different companies and all require reservations in advance!</strong> Making your planning even more difficult.</p><p>For those who do not want to deal with planning for the route, reservations, carrying heavy gears and food, you can consider to hire a tour agency. There are many options online. But again, you have to book everything early in advance! Two types of services are commonly provided, self-guided tour and guided tour. For self-guided tour, everything including meals will be arranged by the tour agency. All you need is a large daypack and start hiking. Based on my experience, all trails are clearly marked and very easy to follow. But if you want more secure, you can have a guide with you. However, convenience come at a HIGH cost! For 5-day self-guided W-trek, it can easily cost you <strong>over 1000 USD</strong>!!! If you do it yourself, probably the total cost for W-trek is around <strong>200 USD</strong> if you stay over at basic campsite with your own food.</p><h2 id="Lan’s-Partial-amp-Practical-W-Trek-Route"><a href="#Lan’s-Partial-amp-Practical-W-Trek-Route" class="headerlink" title="Lan’s Partial &amp; Practical W-Trek Route"></a>Lan’s Partial &amp; Practical W-Trek Route</h2><p>My target in Paine was the W-trek. Hiring a tour agency is way over my budget and not even possible for me since I did not have any reservation before I arrived Puerto Natales! On the other hand, I could not see myself carrying 75L huge backpack with all basic camping gears and food hiking on ‘Patagonia flat’ for 5+ days. Maybe I could if I really pushed hard on myself, but why? I was there to enjoy not to torture myself.</p><p>So I spent a day visiting various tour agencies in the tiny Puerto Natales town searching for alternative ways to conquer the W-trek. Unfortunately, the tour agencies did not offer good information. The alternatives they suggested was to do 3 separate day-hikes covering 70-80% of the W-trek. The cost quotes was from 400 - 650 USD for that, not including the accommodations in Puerto Natales. I was a little disappointed until I went inside a tour agency who only make bus reservations for their customer. A mid-aged lady greeted me and helped me to plan my perfect budget friendly W-trek. </p><p>I planned everything on my own. If you do NOT want to carry huge backpack and not want to spend a ton of money for the W-trek, this is for you.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=150bxY_TuvN6FSbEBzu06hzBqXNemsluK"><p><em>There was an error in my route map above. I did not make it to Campamento Brittanico on D2. That was way to long for after the bus and ferry for a day. I only made it to Glaciar del Frances</em></p><h3 id="Detailed-Plan"><a href="#Detailed-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Detailed Plan"></a>Detailed Plan</h3><p><strong>Day 1: Mirador Las Torres</strong></p><p>The sight of Mirador Las Torres is one of the most iconic in all of Torres del Paine and the landmark of the park! Start from Puerto Natales and take a bus to the park. You will return Puerto Natales that day.</p><p>Total Distance of the Day: 22.45 km (difficult)</p><p><strong>Day 2: Valle del Frances &amp; Glacier del Frances</strong></p><p>Again, start from Puerto Natales and take the bus to <strong>Guarderia Pudeto</strong>. From there, you need to wait for a boat which will take you across Pehoe Lake. This day, I checked in <strong><a href="https://www.vertice.travel/refugio-paine-grande/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Refugio Paine Grande</a></strong> for the overnight stay. You can put your extra stuff in the refugio, and finish the relatively easy day for French Valley and reach to Glaciar del Frances. <em>There was an error in my route map above. I did not make it to Campamento Brittanico. That was way to long for after the bus and ferry for a day.</em></p><p>Total Distance of the Day: 18.74 km (moderate)</p><p><strong>Day 3: Glacier Grey</strong></p><p>Easy start from Refugio Paine Grande, and hike all the way to Refugio Grey. This was my highlight of Paine! It was my first time to see a glacier! You will need to catch the last ferry at 6 p.m. and then the bus back to Puerto Natales.</p><p>Total Distance: 24.65 km (moderate to difficult)</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>If you follow this route, the only part you will miss from W-trek will be from Campamento Italiano back to the park’s main entrance. However, if you stay one more night at <strong><a href="https://www.vertice.travel/refugio-paine-grande/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Refugio Paine Grande</a></strong> or Campamento Italiano, you actually can complete the entire W-trek! <strong><a href="https://www.vertice.travel/refugio-paine-grande/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Refugio Paine Grande</a></strong> is actually a VERY NICE AND COMFY refugio for an overnight stay, it has a bar a restaurant there. But starting from here back to the main entrance in a day could be a very LONG day for you. On the other hand, Campamento Italiano may seem to be a much reasonable stayover choose. But it is a campsite and you need to bring your own tent and food of course. Plus, this is a very basic campsite…</p><h3 id="Total-Cost"><a href="#Total-Cost" class="headerlink" title="Total Cost"></a>Total Cost</h3><p>So here was the cost breakdown for my 3-day hike.</p><ul><li><p>Park Entrance Ticket: 21,000 CLP (~ 27 USD), valid for 3-day</p></li><li><p>Bus to Paine: 30,000 CLP (~ 38 USD). Two round trip ticket, one to Paine park D1 and D2 and D3 round trip to <strong>Guarderia Pudeto</strong>. The regular bus to the park also stops at <strong>Guarderia Pudeto</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Bus Transfer from Main Entrance to Trail: 6,000 CLP (~ 8 USD) round trip. The trail head to the TOWERS (<strong>Mirador Las Torres</strong>) locates 7 km away from the park entrance. You can hike if you like but I suggest you to save your energy.</p></li><li><p>Boat Ticket: 46,000 CLP (~ 58 USD). One-way ticket is 23,000 CLP.</p></li><li><p>One Night Dorm at Refugio Grande: 34,000 CLP (~ 43 USD). One-bed only in mixed 6-person dorm. A pure bed and a pillow only! Not even including sheets and blankets! Of course, you can have those at a higher price. So I brought a rented sleeping bag!</p></li><li><p>Rent for Sleeping Bag: 8,000 CLP (~ 10 USD) for two day (Day 2 and Day 3).</p></li><li><p>Buffet Dinner at <strong>Refugio Grande</strong>: 18,000 CLP (~ 23 USD). They say that the refugio has a kitchen. Yes, even a indoor kitchen compared to other campsite, this one is definitely a luxury kitchen. However, you need to bring your own gas stove and pot for cooking. So I went for a luxury dinner at the refugio but that is totally optional cost. I mean if you can control tempt for a warm meal after your long and exhausting hiking day in the windy and cold weather probably with your partially wet jacket.</p></li><li><p>Snacks: 6,000 CLP (~ 8 USD). Mixed nuts, hams and breakfast in the wild…</p></li></ul><p>In the end, my 3-day partial W-trek costed me <strong>169,000 CLP (~ 215 USD)</strong> with everything included! I was quite proud of myself making this budget multiday trekking in Paine.</p><h3 id="Before-You-Go"><a href="#Before-You-Go" class="headerlink" title="Before You Go"></a>Before You Go</h3><p>There are extra information you may want to know before you go.</p><ul><li>First, it takes about <strong>2-HOUR</strong> by bus to get to/back Torres del Paine National Park. Plan your hike accordingly, especially for day hike! You will need to spend 4+ hours on the bus not including 7-8 hours hiking for the day!</li><li>‘Patagonian Flat’ is not flat! The rolling steppe that surrounds the striking mountains of the Paine Massif is referred to as “Patagonian flat” terrain. Whilst it may be true that the land is flatter than the mountains themselves, to call it <em>flat</em> is still a bit of a misnomer. The land undulates constantly up and down so be prepared to take it in your stride.</li><li>Be prepared for the unpredictable and challenging weather. Everybody knows that Patagonia’s notorious winds. But I did my hike in late November to early December, I experienced rain, snow and hail in a day?! I believe I don’t even need to mention the <strong>STRONG</strong> wind. It’s always there with you!</li><li>Drinkable water is not an issue. Water around the park is safe to drink untreated. However, I was not that brave to drink untreated water directly from the creek, water fall or river in the park. But luckily, there are campsites and refugios along the trek, and there are water stations here. Some refugios even provide hot water for hikers.</li><li>You can make your reservation for <strong><a href="https://www.vertice.travel/refugio-paine-grande/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Refugio Paine Grande</a></strong> directly at their office in Puerto Natales. The company also operates <strong>Refugio Paine Grey</strong> and two campsites inside the park. Based on what I have seen, they have the best refugio and campsite. I highly recommend you plan at least one-night at their refugio!</li><li>Although there are many hostel options in Puerto Natales. I suggest you to find one near bus terminal. Remember, it’s 2-hour one way bus to Paine and another 2-hour back. You don’t want to walk the extra steps before and after your hiking. At least that was what I did. I moved out from my very fancy backpacker’s hostel (2km away from the bus terminal) to a very basic Chilean family run guesthouse which was only one block away the bus terminal. The owner does not even speak English. But I managed it and had a single room with private bathroom and breakfast included for only 15,000 CLP (~ 19 USD) per night. </li></ul><h1 id="Lan-on-the-TREK"><a href="#Lan-on-the-TREK" class="headerlink" title="Lan on the TREK"></a>Lan on the TREK</h1><h2 id="Day-1-to-Mirador-Las-Torres"><a href="#Day-1-to-Mirador-Las-Torres" class="headerlink" title="Day 1 to Mirador Las Torres"></a>Day 1 to Mirador Las Torres</h2><p>My first hiking day in Paine and I devoted my full energy to the landmark of Torres del Paine, the Towers. So I got up at 5:30 a.m. After finishing my breakfast quickly, I hopped on the first bus to the park at 7:00 a.m. After two hours, we arrived the entrance of the park. Then a quick mandatory park instruction were given. Next, our group queued up for purchasing the park ticket. I was very excited and all set for the hike but still the trail head is 7 km away! So I had to take another transfer bus to the real trail head!</p><p>Finally I had my foot on the trail a little pasted 9:30 a.m. and was greeted by a cute Patagonian red fox.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14OXhOLDS8U1joszlAuNfT819eUjVauXD"><p>The Towers in the far distance. Photo taken from the very beginning of the trail.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=199q-WgVDmWdja8OtzA8N7ZKzsrRNfkFo"><p>The trail quickly left the base of the park and took me deep into the nature, the snow-capped mountain, the  turquoise green lake and long windy narrow trail through a green valley. This part of trail was mostly easy with a gradual ascent up to <strong>Refugio Chileno</strong>.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aPT6HG6AFHOckmIcs1TUnSdEGHx7vGqP"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1n2bIApbeOsJGzUMHjKbREO_5hAx5FG7y"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bhD_EwPXEDgYUjh_k-oe6GtMkWKlm8VQ"><p>About two hours later, I reached <strong>Refugio Chileno</strong>. There I had my refuel of bread and ham and a smoke break inside this lovely smoking circle :)</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1t0iTYJof7wtJJDRAKg7bjZHWf4FvNjEG"><p>Then I continued my way to the Towers. The trail led me through a forest, very pleasant and easy walk for about 3 km. Once I was out of the forest, it’s on to the steepest part and final push up to Mirador Las Torres. For about the next kilometer it’s a fairly steep hike to the top. From time to time, I had to climb up and down use both my hands and legs on this rocky trail…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1i6jv0F_fW0jn78ILEg7PDs4pi8j4SvYj"><p>After this strenuous but manageable climb, this is the climax of the day, the <strong>Mirador Las Torres</strong>.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ii7ci6uytiESi5yixPE7URedcRwRfudi"><p>It was a difficult day hike. The elevation gain is 900 meters and mostly at the last 1-2 km of the trail. Maybe I was too excited or too exhausted, I lost my glasses on the trail…I should not have changed to sunglass. The sunny time was probably only 1 hour and mostly I had cloudy and raining weather. So from this day on, I wore sunglass for the rest of my South American trip. (I was thinking to buy a new pair of glasses in Buenos Aires, but my trip did not continue to Brazil and ended there.)</p><p>By the time I got back to Puerto Natales, it was almost 10:00 p.m. and was raining again. With empty stomach, I still need to get out for food. By the time I was able to put my wobbly legs on the bed, it was almost midnight…</p><p><strong>Day 1 Statistics</strong></p><ul><li>Wake-up Time: 5:30 a.m.</li><li>Distance: 22.45 km</li><li>Hiking Time: 8:06</li><li>Elevation Gain: 906 m</li><li>In-Vehicle Time: approx.. 4 hours</li><li>Bed Time: 11:45 p.m.</li></ul><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LDouKWDjFoLjFAOPbtPHL7n-KLJB88b9"><h2 id="Day-2-to-Valle-del-Frances-amp-Glacier-del-Frances"><a href="#Day-2-to-Valle-del-Frances-amp-Glacier-del-Frances" class="headerlink" title="Day 2 to Valle del Frances &amp; Glacier del Frances"></a>Day 2 to Valle del Frances &amp; Glacier del Frances</h2><p>After only less than 6-hour’s sleep, I was up again at 5:30 a.m. and ready for my second day hike in Paine. The regular bus to the park also stops at <strong>Guarderia Pudeto</strong>, where you can take the <a href="http://hipsur.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ferry</a> to across the brilliant turquoise colored Pehoe Lake. </p><p>The hike to French Valley and the hanging glacier (Glacier del Frances) starts at <strong>Refugio Paine Grande</strong>. Before I started my hike, I first checked in my room at Refugio so that I could drop my sleeping bag, food supplies etc. Yes, I tried to carry only essentials in my daypack, only water, camera and some small snacks for the day. I thought the refugio in the park would only be very basic, however, this one exceeded my expectation. It has a restaurant, a bar, a lounge with amazing view and generally speaking very modern design. I sat in the lounge for a while and did not even want to get out to the trail in the cold and windy weather…</p><p>The view from the lounge and I could have spent my whole day there. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ppd9-fPzcZGTy-0d0GKCXPhbQjcAxTzO"><p>Then my very basic dorm but very clean and bed was very comfy. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1J5JI-00RK7if2brsi2uxsFVxQsbg7UIE"><p>Refugio Paine Grande also has a campsite with tents already setup for you. Those were very popular and I couldn’t get one tent since they were fully booked. OK, to be honest, I would prefer to sleep on a real bed indoor even if there were some free spots.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QCvorFm182MrNBEVc-wAhQcnuLcmrRCP"><p>My last check was the KITCHEN. As the company’s agency told me that I could bring food and cook my own meal in the kitchen when I made my reservation. This was the kitchen and dinning room. Very clean like nothing inside. My fault of misunderstanding the word ‘KITCHEN’s’ meaning in Paine. Not a kitchen with a stove, pots, plates, utensils as common sense told me. A kitchen for camping means that there would be a place for you to set your own fire, or gas stove. You have to bring everything for cooking!!! How naive I was with really only my own food there. But the quality of this kitchen was the best I ever seen during my three day hike in Paine. OK, I got one task, cooking dinner, removed from my to-do-list of the day.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yXMFSCffFcN9ImY22td64wBYbCNw4Okg"><p>Finally, I made up my mind to leave the refugio. The view of the trail was breathtaking! Two tough hikers were already on their way with their huge backpacks. Thank god, I have my 15L daypack on my back for the day, otherwise I might die on the trail.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Nv-Qic4-nLW0YVOl74ST3V3RA9mWXZnA"><p>First part of the trail was along Pehoe Lake. It was an very easy and pleasant walk. The only complain was the notorious Patagonia wind. I had never experienced such strong wind for such long time… I actually had three layers over my head, my beanie from Peru, the hood of my Northface hoodie, and lastly the hood of my jacket. Even with all three layers, I still felt a little bit headache from the wind…</p><p>The trail goes up and down fairly gentle hills. There are open areas, rolling hills. Then the trail led me through a forest of dead trees.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KEE8eWzfpg4kGbqCcKfSZmFBdVaInE8-"><p>There are also bushes that are dotted with bright red flowers in late November when I was there.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1u0B7r6epQpsaSOjlfJTqXwdRqX_2sLQy"><p>This section of the trail ends at a footbridge over a river, the Rio de Frances. After crossing the river, I arrived Campamento Italiano. There I had my bread and ham for lunch. Then I continued my second section of today’s trail, up to <strong>Mirador Valle de Frances</strong>. Compared to the ascending rocky trail up to the Towers on my first day, this uphill trail was relatively easier. I was up to the viewpoint and there it was, the hanging glacier, Glacier del Frances. Weather was not good and it snowed a little bit. But still the view was very cool and so as the temperature there…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14tDdRGjzTUKbNvJuOvqh2xaxLQUdvqCm"><p>The trail continues uphill to Mirador Brittanico, but I turned back, as it was getting a little late and I did not want to hike in the dark back to my refugio. On my way back, the views of the lake was stunning! But still another 9 km to hike back to my lovely dinner and comfy bed…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ySN8wD9b82bk9LrBNBcDL-iJg2jgs5Qd"><p>Although I brought some pasta and canned tuna for my planned self-cooking dinner, I was not able to do that without camping gas stove and pot. I was sitting in the lobby and watching other travelers having dinner and beer in the dinning room. The price for the dinner buffet was 18,000 CLP (~ 23 USD). Normally I would not be willing to spend that much money on a meal. But I just hiked over 40 km in two days and experienced server weather (wind, snow and a little hail). Looking at people passing by with mountains of beef stew and grilled chicken on their plates, my mouth started watering and my stomach joined by roaring. OK, I gave up my stingy normal traveling style and went in for the luxury buffet. Sorry, I did not take any pictures since I was too hungry to do anything else than eating… a little embarrassed, I actually finished 2.5 plates of meat with some rice and bread…</p><p>So I went back to my dorm with satisfying stomach. There I found two roommates already on their bed. First, I was a little bit concerned about the that night’s sleeping. Normally, I seldom had good sleep in shared dorm. People were continuously making some noise until late at night and sometimes people got up really early. Patagonian shared dorm surprised me again. By 8:30 p.m., my roommates already fell into asleep?! Also, it was very quite outside as well. Our dorm was actually facing the shared bathroom. That meant most people were already on the bed. I quickly turned off my cellphone and joined the sleeping club at 8:45 p.m. I guess everybody was exhausted in Paine. </p><p><strong>Day 2 Statistics</strong></p><ul><li>Wake-up Time: 5:30 a.m.</li><li>Distance: 18.75 km</li><li>Hiking Time: 6:27</li><li>Elevation Gain: 470 m</li><li>In-Vehicle Time: approx. 2 hours</li><li>On-Boat Time: approx. 40 min </li><li>Bed Time: 8:45 p.m.</li></ul><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LGwXk5aH4FoPLavC2REQJ7etAgwix6I9"><h2 id="Day-3-to-Glacier-Grey"><a href="#Day-3-to-Glacier-Grey" class="headerlink" title="Day 3 to Glacier Grey"></a>Day 3 to Glacier Grey</h2><p>This day I got up really late at 7:30 a.m. My entire body was aching and I doubted if I could continue to hike. For a second, I wanted to give up and just spend my time leisurely at the lobby. But I pushed myself to get out of the comfy bed and had my breakfast in the lounge. The menu for the breakfast was ham, 3-day old flat wheat bread and a cup of hot coffee with amazing view of Paine!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wSyvuQKAX7SXutB-a0b_w9vzrcoFJQhB"><p>After the breakfast, I was on the trail to Glacier Grey. This day hike to Glacier Grey was my favorite among the three hikes I did in Paine.</p><p>This trek is very scenic. Beautiful snow-capped moutain.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cF5NHkZs-opx5bKaFGxhjc1cPYuzKRsB"><p>The first section of the trek climbed steadily but not steeply up.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12_tDXOVRQ4Y3BuurNlc1grlk3eCuHhei"><p>When I reached the edge, there it was, the beautiful Lake Grey with some floating icebergs for the very first time. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pEFsWzU6C5dssuNRappz3FHxgYiJekJJ"><p>Approximately after six kilometers, I got to the Mirador Grey, from where was yet another rewarding view of the glacier in the distance. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uutidfiqKMNwhhx9bbKEpocmfVPTvs_F"><p>From here, the trail went quite steeply down. After the descending, the trail again continued up and down until I reached Refugio Grey. From here it is less than one kilometer left to get to the viewpoint right in front Glacier Grey.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=17UVkAHVD9peENUF6L6vJefmrRyH1FOqa"><p>This day I was a little bit in a hurry to complete the hike since I need to catch the last ferry back to Puerto Natales at 18:30 and I knew that the round trip for the hike was over 20+ KM. So I only snapped some photos quickly at the view point and went back. </p><p>Although I was in a hurry, nothing stopped me from having my lunch break. I was accompanied by a handsome bird or eagle at the porch outside of Refugio Grey during my break. Oh, by the way, you can refuel your water bottle there as well. The waitress in the bar even generously gave me several tea bags and hot water!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KEFj_L1uNC8m6tVajEWVxURC8xQOv2dc"><p>After the break, I rushed back and probably made my record of my fastest speed of hiking averaging 5+ km per hour. Note that it was on a trail winding up and down through rocks and loose gravels. So I made it back to Refugio Paine Grande before 6 p.m. and people already started to lined up at the dock waiting for the last ferry back.</p><p>This was a long day of hiking and I was still 45-minute ferry plus 2-hour bus ride away from my hostel in Puerto Natales.</p><p><strong>Day 3 Statistics</strong></p><ul><li>Wake-up Time: 7:30 a.m.</li><li>Distance: 24.65 km</li><li>Hiking Time: 8:30</li><li>Elevation Gain: N/A </li><li>In-Vehicle Time: approx. 2 hours</li><li>On-Boat Time: approx. 40 min </li><li>Bed Time: 11:30 p.m.</li></ul><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LFfXPsbTZjdv1JmcOFNoxycaj0JUpFKo"><h2 id="Suggestions-after-My-3-Day-Hike-in-Paine"><a href="#Suggestions-after-My-3-Day-Hike-in-Paine" class="headerlink" title="Suggestions after My 3-Day Hike in Paine"></a>Suggestions after My 3-Day Hike in Paine</h2><p>I really like Refugio Paine Grande and Refugio Grey. Both were operated by the same <a href="https://www.vertice.travel/alojamientos/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">company</a> and reservations can be made either at their office in Puerto Natales or on their website.</p><p>If I would re-plan my route, I would stay one more night on D3 at Refugio Grey and extend this route one more day so that you can a little go further into the O-trek from Refugio Grey and also time-wise you are not so tightened up for catching the last ferry back to town.</p><h1 id="Food-in-Puerto-Natales"><a href="#Food-in-Puerto-Natales" class="headerlink" title="Food in Puerto Natales"></a>Food in Puerto Natales</h1><p>Puerto Natales was a very small town and main serves as the base for Torres del Paine National Park. Maybe I was at a wrong place for good Chilean food or maybe my dinner time was outside of the normal business hours of the restaurants there. Anyway, I was very disappointed at the Chilean food again. </p><p>Two dinners on the day before my 3-day hike in Paine. The first meal at a cheap restaurant was a Chilean steak with French fries and an egg. It was very oily and taste was not good as well. It costed 5,000 CLP (~ 6.5 USD).</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Gauv5dBlhfU1I2HLjl8rPdMX0G9szI6B"><p>I did not finish my first plate. Thinking that I would start my 3-day hike tomorrow and probably would not have time for any decent meal. I went to a Japanese restaurant nearby. This was what I got. Again very disappointing. This was anything far from the Sushi I know. This roll costed 3,900 CLP (~ 5 USD).</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ko8_28fRmunAEue5Xq_tfyq8RR0SCRIy"><p>So the next day after my long hike to and back from the Towers, I went to a relatively higher end restaurant. A grilled chicken breast with mushroom sauce with salad and a bottle of beer. The taste was just OK. This meal costed me 13,200 CLP (~ 17 USD). At least, I felt full after the meal.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1A8T90GXRk0n0RoxREhxefC1zIMKPi9Yc"><p>Probably, the best meal I had in Puerto Natales was a pizza restaurant. I went there twice during my stay in Puerto Natales. Pizza cost 9,400 CLP (~12 USD). </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1C4ZTxIG9xWRYdgwWJyT1A209zANmrfha"><p>Oh, Chile, you disappointed me by not that tasty food with high costs. I was ready to say goodbye to Chile and return to my dear meat master, Argentina!</p><h1 id="Log"><a href="#Log" class="headerlink" title="Log"></a>Log</h1><p>Puerto Natales stay from November 26 to December 2, 2019.</p><p>Next stop:  El Calafate, Argentina.

      &lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of Patagonia (No, not the famous outdoor brand)? Patagonia has a fixed spot on the list of &lt;strong&gt;the most amazing hiking areas in the world&lt;/strong&gt;! This GRANDE region shared by Argentina and Chile displays some of the most thrilling natural sceneries on the planet. Of all of them, Chile’s &lt;strong&gt;Torres del Paine&lt;/strong&gt; may be the most attractive. Hiking in Torres del Paine was on the bucket list of almost every backpackers I met in South America. For my personal record, I hiked three days in a row with a total distance of over 65 km in Torres del Paine National Park. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ushuaia, the southmost city in the world, I went there primarily to hunt for a last-minute Antarctica cruise deal. Although I did not fulfill my goal to visit Antarctica, I experienced the beauty of nature around Ushuaia. Yes, the city has more than Antarctica cruise lines! For those whose budget does not allow a cruise trip, you should still visit Ushuaia. It won’t let you down! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mxSG5_CRF4a_mmxJGhyPkTPUozM09Xew"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="LONG-Flight-to-Ushuaia"><a href="#LONG-Flight-to-Ushuaia" class="headerlink" title="LONG Flight to Ushuaia"></a>LONG Flight to Ushuaia</h1><p>From Mendoza, there is no direct flight to Ushuaia. So I booked a cheap flight (not very cheap, it was over 200 USD) with Norwegian Air with 7.5 hour-layover at Buenos Aires, adding another 5 hours flight time. This long flight to Ushuaia was over 12 hours, which was OK for a budget backpacker like me. Both of my flights was with Norwegian Air. I thought I did not need to take my bag and check it in again at Buenos Aires. But the Mendoza Norwegian Air agent told me I need to take my bag and check in again at Buenos Aires. Fine, I would do that.  My complain was that once I arrived Buenos Aires, Norwegian Air rejected to check-in my baggage?! They only accept check-in 3 hours before the flight. I was planning to find a nice place in Buenos Aires to spent several hours. It turned out that I was trapped in the airport with my huge backpack…</p><p>My only option was to kill sometime with my warming American uncle - McDonald’s. Thank god, at least there was free WiFi at the terminal. McDonald’s was my official South American airport meal place now. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZjuxkcMCJlTx6zTvAxeZUBvila1J_Rbp"><p>A budget backpacker gets service for what you paid…Nobody was at the airline counters. Agents only show up 3 hours before their flight. Being stranded at the airport for about 4 hours, I was able to join the first pack of travelers waiting for the counters to open.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19uvLIW6RlGpo3e0A7VPufhKZzGepPm3_"><p>Finally I was able to get to my gate at 4 p.m. Note that I left my hostel in Mendoza at 7:30 a.m. to catch the 9:30 a.m. flight to Buenos Aires. Finally, I had the opportunity for a decent meal of the day. There were only few choices near my gate. So again, my pick was another non South American restaurant and Mexican food?</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tVKgCTSF2ooohTB6Ung4ZFweMTcEDOTt"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1av0h22G3dF6JxqZ6wHdX4uv2nPmunlfT"><p>Finally, I arrived Ushuaia at around 11 p.m. When I got out of the airport, it was so COLD. Remember, Mendoza was in the desert region and all of a sudden, I was here in Ushuaia, and they called it SUMMER? </p><h1 id="Hunt-for-Antarctica-Cruise-Last-Minute-Deal-Mission-FAILED"><a href="#Hunt-for-Antarctica-Cruise-Last-Minute-Deal-Mission-FAILED" class="headerlink" title="Hunt for Antarctica Cruise Last Minute Deal - Mission FAILED"></a>Hunt for Antarctica Cruise Last Minute Deal - Mission FAILED</h1><p>The very next day, I was ready to start my hunt for Antarctica cruise deals. Unfortunately, it was a holiday in Argentina. Most shops and travel agencies were closed. Hunting day 1 turned out to be a city walking tour.</p><p>Empty holiday street in Ushuaia.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1r0D84kqPsMj8uB8CaCb-YV0uqb6OeATW"><p>Then I arrived the city sign near harbor.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZDEoDkUKpHPdYpYFRqMRfBW2za6-b0sT"><p>Then the downtown. OK, as a very small town, there was not much to see in Ushuaia.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uAjF3bkbwA0Odkr5vVBNYC-xOEIrhJT2"><p>The second day, finally a normal business day. I was recommended several travel agencies specialized in Antarctica cruises. So I went to downtown again. It turned out that most of the agencies only had limited options within next 10 days. The lowest quote was <strong>4400 USD</strong> not including insurance, cruise tips and rent for jackets?! This was way above my budget!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Uq8_T9wHN_DQiNl1z4mm7HcYYYWmFNAI"><p>So I returned to my hostel very disappointed. Surprisingly, there were quite a few Chinese (from mainland, Hongkong and Taiwan) all came for Antarctica cruises. The only difference was they all had their cruise booked! So we exchanged our information. After showing my quotes, they all said that was cheap?! Their prices were much higher. I am sorry to lower the average Chinese wealthy level. Yes, there are several Chinese cruise lines to Antarctica with Chinese cruise members and daily Chinese food offered on cruise. How rich they are. My hostel was also run by a Taiwanese family. The owner kindly gave me a Chinese travel agent contact. After several hours of chatting on WeChat with the Chinese agent. I was able to secure a deal for 10-day cruise at a price of 4200 USD with only 200 USD extra for tips.</p><p>Since I did not have that much cash with me, I had to pay with my U.S. debt card. I spent most of my third day in hostel trying all kinds of ways to transfer money to my Chinese agent. The travel agency was based in China. I had to either transfer money to their mainland or Hongkong bank accounts. And the cruise would depart in 2 days?!  I really struggled to make the payment and found there were no easy way to do that. In the end, I decided to give up. I had enough of it! The price was already beyond my 3000 USD budget and I already wasted three days here in Ushuaia doing nothing?! Also, I figured out that you probably do not need to be very young and physically perfect to take the Antarctica cruise. OK, I will give Ushuaia a second chance for my future visit. Now let me do some hard work at a relatively young age, HIKING! I need to get moving again!</p><div class="note ">            <h4 id="What-made-my-hunt-so-difficult"><a href="#What-made-my-hunt-so-difficult" class="headerlink" title="What made my hunt so difficult?"></a>What made my hunt so difficult?</h4><p>Most shops open at 9 a.m. and they close at mid-day from 1-4 p.m. then re-open at 4-8 p.m. I did not know it on my second day and arrived downtown too late like 11 a.m. making me only 2 hours to visit 2-3 travel agencies. Then I found out that it was their midday resting time. I had to walk all the way back (2km) to my hostel and came back downtown later in the afternoon. It was not fun at all.</p>          </div><h1 id="Tierra-del-Fuego-National-Park"><a href="#Tierra-del-Fuego-National-Park" class="headerlink" title="Tierra del Fuego National Park"></a>Tierra del Fuego National Park</h1><p>After I decided to end my meaningless and disappointing hunt for Antarctica cruise, I made up my mind to enjoy some nature beauty of Ushuaia. My first hiking spot was <strong>Tierra del Fuego National Park</strong> <strong>(land of fire)</strong>.  You may heard of Patagonia, the heaven for nature lovers and adventurers.  Yes, more hiking adventures will come soon in famous <strong><em>Torres del Paine</em> and <em>El Chaltén</em>, the capital of trekking</strong>. Tierra de Fuego National Park was the easiest hike I had in Patagonia. But it all of the magic and beauty that Patagonia is renowned for. Within the park, there are lakes, rivers and waterways, expansive nothingness and untouched corners that no one has even ventured into.</p><p>Pictures worth a thousand words. The following were taken along my hiking in Tierra de Fuego National park. Stunning landscapes and colors of nature!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1e43HSnD33uVc_mTDaEGTvqzu14NeWA5I"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12QYXIuhWgW1mFA_2XYKElntQtQDK8eH9"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1BsWnu26ImL1MRpDdukJyf1sqYjQZnkRT"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NtKHPmQNxgNfCf1HANr2B5DnPjx5QsZN"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Xw1YoMYtxcf2SshSOjPI674tTIq13aQV"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10F1N9fK6HwlbHuJolpyaU9R5868fmMHa"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1q1lTuxk8wrEgC1EA7U5E_0wXhefkMFXZ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16EZ3oxeIluTlXefgAPPZKIiVzWwts75e"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YTH_58Od-fSOJgLhToj70xqLf7-v0d0F"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=17Dwn0UNfJ-aMmRqj_npWQl5Sa6GBu-In"><h2 id="Tips"><a href="#Tips" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h2><p><strong>How to get to the park?</strong></p><p>You can take a bus at the bus terminal close to Ushuaia downtown to the park. For convenience and my own laziness, I booked a bus transfer directly at my hostel for 850 ARS (~ 12 USD), including round trip to the park, hostel pickup and drop-off. There were several stops along this bus route. Depends on how long you would like to hike, you can choose any stops to get off. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_-2L5MismQ0twIlQXOWqbAExvRcPGlEW"><p>The park entrance ticket is 560 ARS (~ 8 USD). </p><p><strong>The Southmost Post Office</strong></p><p>I did not take the end of the world train but I did mailed several postcards from the world southmost post office and got my passport stamped there. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QZFTuW_oaBvMjxhAyifWqKvbmYI2B8K3"><div class="note ">            <h4 id="DO-NOT-STAMP-YOUR-PASSPORT"><a href="#DO-NOT-STAMP-YOUR-PASSPORT" class="headerlink" title="DO NOT STAMP YOUR PASSPORT"></a>DO NOT STAMP YOUR PASSPORT</h4><p>In many places, you would find PASSPORT STAMP STATION. Although it clearly says passport stamp in their sings, you should NOT stamp your passport! I was tempted to put three stamps on my passport, Rainbow Mountain, Machu Picchu and this end of the world post office. While the first two stamps were regular stamps and did not take too much space on my passport. This end of the world post office took ENTIRE PAGE?!</p><p>U.S. regular passport book only has 28 pages (20 pages for passport stamps). You may think that’s a lot of pages for traveling. NO, it is not enough! For my South American trip, it took almost 10 pages. Now I used another page for stamps? Stupid decision! <strong>Also, later I found that it was illegal to put any non-passport stamp on your passport, at least for U.S. passport.</strong></p><p>So please, bring a passport size notebook if you want to collect souvenir stamps.</p>          </div><p><strong>One-Day Hiking</strong></p><p>There were three trekking trails inside the park. If you want to hike all of them, you need to spend two days in the park. I only did the Costera trail and Hito XXIV trail. There was another one from bus stop 2 to Cerro Guanaco trail (the mountain Guanaco ). For the one I did, it was an easy hike mostly flat. The total distance was only less than 17 km. Again, the easiest hike in Patagonia.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ei9677qUP9TmQz6w5NzSTLhbx-XiZ36x"><h1 id="Laguna-Esmeralda-My-DANGEROUS-Adventure"><a href="#Laguna-Esmeralda-My-DANGEROUS-Adventure" class="headerlink" title="Laguna Esmeralda - My DANGEROUS Adventure"></a>Laguna Esmeralda - My DANGEROUS Adventure</h1><div class="note quote">            <p>The one to Laguna Esmeralda easily qualifies as <strong>the best hike in Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia</strong>. It’s not a strenuous trek at all – it is fairly short and with very little ascent. The stunning scenery and the challenges of the trail, however, make it one you will remember. If you plan to just go on one hike when you visit Ushuaia, make sure it is this one.</p>          </div><p>So everyone says Laguna Esmeralda is a fantastic trek and very short, like 9 km round trip. One should be able to complete the trek in 4-5 hours. Ha, a half day hiking, how easy was that! I confidently went there with only one bottle of water no snack.</p><p>My transfer bus picked me up from my hostel at around 10 a.m. The scheduled return time was 4 p.m. I was a little bit concerned about how to kill time since I thought I would be definitely finish the hike in 4 hours, or 4.5 hours at most. Come on, as Google told me, the trek is fairly short and with very little ascent. I was too confident and got lost on this easy trek by making the WRONG, and DANGEROUS long detour. The one-way trek to the lake should be less than 5 km and my long way to the lake took me almost 12 KM?!</p><p>Long story in short, the following map was the real route I took for this Laguna Esmeralda. I thought I may die in the mountain at some point of the day…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lPeMDycEVJNuzoYf31iRrm95BIbeWtxm"><p>That morning, I was very relaxing on the bus still thinking today would be an easy day. On our way to the trail head, our bus stopped at a view point. Stunning scenery with nice weather, a great day for hiking!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13sTwkbyRKQupjFzPg-kq5uPo6lBp-cf3"><p>Then our bus arrived at the trail head with about 15 travelers. As a ‘hardcore’ solo hiker, I did not want to stick with the group. So I quickly passed the group while the ‘softer tourists’ were taking endless pictures. For the first 1 KM of the trek, it was nice and easy walking passing through the forest. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1M-C_ic3sjAVi3fPTZIVa3-jRyAOYISr7"><p>Then quickly I found myself alone on the trail. Yes, there was people chatting and laughing behind me previously. To enjoy the peaceful nature alone, I was trying to walk fast to pass our group as soon as possible. This was a WRONG decision. But I was still walking on a trail with clear marks meaning that it is a trail for people to walk. Stupid me was feeling happy to finally be alone owing this whole nature. So I slowed down and started to take some photos and had some rests. Then I was joined by an Argentinean girl, who came from Buenos Aries and it was her first solo backpacker trip. I was very sorry for this poor girl and later you would know why…So we started to hike together. However, for the next half an hour, we did not meet or hear anybody?! I started to wonder if we were on the right trail. We passed several signs but they were all in Spanish. She read the signs and pointed out the markers on the trees confirming that we were right on track. Another half an hour passed, I found we arrived at an area where no trails were there. What I mean by no trails or roads? Check the following was what we passed.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_zRjQMe4m8qwx_Jno0U6SHrw02K5Wvo0"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GuSy_6sALYpf3VsvDSM30bkJccl0Q_b6"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11__P5FtgfXDg-9R0OpGUr6JDOXyehQRs"><p>Do you think that I was standing on the trail to take those pictures? NO, I was standing in the middle of nowhere!!! All we had was endless peatland. For those who don’t know what is peatland, here is the description from Google.</p><div class="note ">            <h4 id="Peatland"><a href="#Peatland" class="headerlink" title="Peatland"></a>Peatland</h4><p>Peatlands are a distinctive <strong>wetland</strong> type, characterized by the accumulation of partially decayed organic matter, forming layers of peat.</p>          </div><p>So basically, it may look like grassland with small ponds. What we really walked on was wetland. Our boots were stuck in the mud and we had to pull out legs hard to get out of the mud traps. The girl fell several times and I had to return to rescue her. Here, again, I had to thank <a href="https://maps.me/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps.Me</a> which saved our life! Since the trail disappeared, I took my cellphone out and started to use <a href="https://maps.me/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps.Me</a> to navigate us to the lake. Also I confirmed that we took the wrong path. But we were a little bit far from returning back to the correct one and <a href="https://maps.me/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps.Me</a> showed the alternative path to the lake. So I thought we should not return but to continue. I did not know it would lead us to cross endless peatland. I had to say although the App took us to a difficult path, I was still thankful to this app to navigate us in the middle of nowhere! And it actually was a ‘trail’ just no clear man-walked path since we saw blue ribbons on the trees from time to time. Time passed and we had been on the trail from about 3 hours but still there were no lake?! The Argentinean girl was very upset and worried about our safety. She wanted to go back but I just kept walking. I would not return until I arrive my destination, Laguna Esmeralda.</p><p>We probably walked on the peatland for about an hour. And finally we saw the lake in the far distance. I had to say, it was a little bit scary path to the lake. So the following what my last challenge to Laguna Esmeralda. The red path was the last part of the detour and the blue line was the CORRECT trail. Yes, we were up high in the mountain and need to get down to the lake…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uquUVQFx8yRxFuil6N6-hQBwHzFVrsCk"><p>First, there were two hanging glaciers, or just huge snow falls on the slide of the hill we need to cross. It was very slippery and on a little bit steep slope. Even me fell down, slid a few feet downhill and got my palms cut by the rocks.  My dangerous move made the Argentinean girl almost cried and decided to give up. She shouted to me, ‘Lan, I cannot do it! I have to turn back, sorry and you just continue.’ </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=191Ql_8P7jWF_gcM1oIRvnBeqI1ljfl6l"><p>No matter how I encouraged her to continue. She just rejected to move on. Maybe I was too tough on her. So I was left alone again. But seriously, after the ‘glaciers’, the rest of the detour was relatively easy and very safe…What I had in front of me was a huge bush forest and a narrow creek. No danger for those two right? Just got some more tiny cuts on my hands and my entire pair of shoes and socks wet. </p><p>So I cross the bush forest.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_eIc4dAtNs470JjUZKt6pdCxKOfsPviF"><p>Then cross this little freezingly cold creek. After crossing the creek, I even spent sometime to wash my shoes inside out, anyway they were completely wet already.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qH21gLXc3MeEtw58WD1hm0CNmPhuEsN1"><p>To document what I passed through, this was the last part of the dangerous detour I took (photo taken on the CORRECT trail looking up).</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11DO1_nNBdSkS10_tkETTh_mc4MfKg3-N"><p>Finally, after almost 5 hours detour, I arrived at Laguna Esmeralda. Yes, that’s it. A lake in the mountain with some snows. Very common view in Patagonia. Later I found, that is what you will get after hiking for 10+ KM one-way in the mountain. At the end, you will find a beautiful lake. Same applies to <strong><em>Torres del Paine</em> and *El Chaltén</strong>.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KIOV0onnSkpA-JQIOUhTriMZyhiAOJfZ"><p>On my way back, this time I was taking the correct trek and again thanks to <a href="https://maps.me/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps.Me</a>. At that point, even I was accompanied by other travelers, I did not trust them nor my instinct. I totally replied on my dear <a href="https://maps.me/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps.Me</a> App… You may thought the correct trail should be an easy one. Of course not, life is never easy at any time. It was a muddy trail and also sometimes there were no clear marked ‘road/path’. This was what I saw on my way back. One guy slipped on the narrow wood crossing bridge and got his leg stuck in the mud up to the knee which he could not get himself out! A group of three people came to rescue him and pulled him out. What an amazing trail!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1c88rr2GWwDL5UxanejftnbC_ACh0ZI_8"><p>Who could tell me where to go in this muddy land?</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1oXO4h4lebFPKuRjDuAxh0UqLekwPKxh3"><p>Then I went back to the forest nearby the trailhead. I found out why I got myself into the WRONG way. Why there was NO SIGN at this bifurcation?!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EPwXoLx_AMrHKberwPFlEDJ_Zxxzn7DE"><p>Undoubtedly, I missed my bus back to Ushuaia when I got out of the trek. Were I worried? No. The trailhead was next to a highway. So I hitchhiked on the side of the road…Luckily, after about five cars passed by, one black Audi SUV stopped, one Argentinean handsome gentleman in suit and tie rowed passenger window down and asked what happened. I explained that I got myself lost on the trek and missed my bus. Carlos, the gentleman smiled and kindly offered me a ride back to Ushuaia. It was not my first hitchhike attempt in South America. But previously I got tuk-tuk motorcycle, a pickup back trunk or a 4x4 off-road SUV. All matched my low-key, dirty and tough backpacker travel style. This time I was very embarrassed since I had mud all over my jacket and pants and my hiking shoes were half-wet, all those clearly did not match the leather seats on this luxury Audi SUV. I know you will never read this blog, but still please accept my deepest thanks to you, Carlos!</p><h2 id="Tips-1"><a href="#Tips-1" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h2><p>While the correct trek to Laguna Esmeralda is a short hike (2 hours in and 2 hours out), please do the following before and/or during the hiking:</p><ul><li>Make sure you are on the right trek. For certain parts, there is NO clear sign!</li><li>Do not be too confident on your instinct. Either follow the group if there is any people around or if you prefer to hike alone, download Maps.Me and get offline map ready on your phone. Start to use the app to guide you from very beginning of the trail!</li><li>Even on the right trail, it can be very muddy and wet. Be prepared for that!</li></ul><p>Last point, there are shuttle buses taking you to the trailhead. You can find them in the bus terminal near downtown. I believe it departs at 9 a.m., 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and returning at 4 p.m. Double check the bus schedule before you go. You can easily combine your day with this hike and a late afternoon Beagle Channel cruise to see the sunset, if you don’t get yourself lost like me…</p><p>No entrance ticket required for this trail.</p><h1 id="Beagle-Channel-Cruise-Tour"><a href="#Beagle-Channel-Cruise-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Beagle Channel Cruise Tour"></a>Beagle Channel Cruise Tour</h1><p>After two hiking days in a row, I decided to take a break and booked myself a Beagle Channel Cruise. I should say, Beagle Channel Cruise is not a must-try in Ushuaia. But still this is kind of a very popular tour in town.</p><p>For me, I thought I had saved myself tons of money by not taking the Antarctica cruise. So I probably booked the most expensive Beagle Channel Cruise with <a href="https://tolkeyenpatagonia.com/tours/navegacion-por-el-mitico-canal-de-beagle-hasta-la-estancia-harberton/?currency=USD" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tolkeyen Patagonia Turismo</a>. For cheaper options, there are lots of travel agencies offering all different kind of cruise lines to Beagle Channel in the harbor area. Like most Beagle Channel cruise, the Tolkeyen cruise visits the sea lion island, cormorants island, the lighthouse, and Penguins colony. The special stop this cruise offers was Harberton farm, where you will have an opportunity to visit the farm’s family house, the nature reserve, shearing warehouse and a sea mammal museum. Then you will take a bus back to Ushuaia. If sailing in the Beagle Channel is something on you list, you probably do NOT need to pay the extra money for visiting Harberton which lower the cost by 50%!</p><p>But the cruise was nice and in general I had a very peaceful and relaxing day without using my legs heavily. Also I was able to see cute animals in their wild habitats. </p><p>Our cruise and the bigger red vessel was the one heading to Antarctica the next day.

With this tour, no hiking was required. You would had an off-road experience, visit several lakes and a canoe experience. Also, the tour include an Argentinean barbecue lunch at their refuge and had the opportunities to see their husky dogs for winter activities. I was very satisfied by the barbecue. OK, maybe I have to admit that whichever tour provided me meat and wine made me happy. </p><p>The handsome SUV for the day!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1P1riwUowj_4EHYPLHHqAApBZigXznChU"><p>Our first stop was one of the refuge of the company for winter activities.

I had three of those…not feeling embarrassed at all!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15pm90DgKFtqUNymk34RBfD0r8Pv_dgzo"><p><strong>Fun Facts Again:</strong></p><p>This tour was the only tour I did in Ushuaia with a guide. So I learnt many things about the region. </p><ul><li><p>The indigenous people of the region is called Yaghan. And in their language, the region’s name is Oshovia (means the deep bay). But when Spanish came, they could not figure out the Yaghan language’s pronunciation. So Ushuaia became the city’s official name.</p></li><li><p>The wetland I crossed in Laguna Esmeralda was called peatland and peats are used to make Scotch whiskey? I thought I just walked on wet grassland on that wrong trek…</p></li><li><p>This is actually a sad fact. The cute beavers were not native to Ushuaia region. They were imported from Canada for with the intention of creating a commercial fur-trading industry. However, the weather in Ushuaia is warmer than Canada resulting no thinner fur growth of the beavers. So they were released. Since they were introduced to the region, they have no natural predators. Beaver population grew quickly in this heaven and has became a threaten to the region’s ecosystem by destroying large amounts of forests and contaminate vast water sources. Both Chile and Argentina agreed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_eradication_in_Tierra_del_Fuego" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beaver eradication in Tierra del Fuego</a>. But those creatures still are making their dams and live a happy life. Yes, I agree that beavers should move out the region but it’s more like a man-made mistake not beavers’ fault. The dead trees in the forest due to beavers.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Xhr_Z1UGh1EXWpa2A_7xshh0c4RB1of9"></li></ul><h2 id="Tips-3"><a href="#Tips-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h2><ul><li>I highly recommend the do the tour with <a href="http://www.antartur.com/excursion/travesia-lagos-4x4" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Antartur</a>. </li><li>I paid 4320 ARS (~ 61 USD) in cash for this tour. Yes, if you pay cash, you get 10% off. Original price was 4800 ARS.</li><li>That’s it! It will be a fun and relaxing tour not requiring lots of physical strength. Everybody can do it.</li></ul><h1 id="Ushuaia-Tips-in-General"><a href="#Ushuaia-Tips-in-General" class="headerlink" title="Ushuaia Tips in General"></a>Ushuaia Tips in General</h1><ul><li><p>For stay, I recommend <a href="https://oshoviahostel.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oshovia</a>. A Taiwanese family own and run hostel, clean, comfy beds and good breakfast included. Their kitchen is fantastic! For 90% of my stay, I cooked my own meal in the hostel. </p></li><li><p>If your hostel is a little bit far from the city center, which was my case. Oshovia is about 30-minute walking to the center. You should get a magnet bus card, called SUBE. The card costs 90 ARS (~ 1.5 USD) but the bus ticket only cost 18 ARS ( ~ 0.25 USD)! Also, this card can be used in Buenos Aries. An amazing city with fantastic public transport system!</p></li><li><p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PuZPdg7in3cqGyy97" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bus terminal of Ushuaia</a> locates on the corner of Avenida Maipu and Juana Genoveva Fadul Sur. There are shuttle buses to Tierra del Fuego Park, Laguna Esmeralda and other places of interests. The price will be cheaper than booked at your hostel probably. The following lists destinations of the shuttle buses and schedule as of November, 2019.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1XXucHoiISg2igI869aK_d7nogMxf9GkN"></li></ul><ul><li><p>Most shops open at 9 a.m. and <strong>they close at mid-day from 1-4 p.m.</strong> then re-open at 4-8 p.m. Plan your shopping time accordingly!</p></li><li><p>If you are a smoker, stock your cigarettes in Ushuaia. Based on my experience, the cheapest place for cigarettes in South America or probably in the world! A pack of Marlboro Gold only cost about 1.2 USD?!</p></li></ul><h1 id="Food-in-Ushuaia"><a href="#Food-in-Ushuaia" class="headerlink" title="Food in Ushuaia"></a>Food in Ushuaia</h1><p>As I said, my hostel <a href="https://oshoviahostel.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oshovia</a> has a fantastic kitchen.

      &lt;p&gt;Ushuaia, the southmost city in the world, I went there primarily to hunt for a last-minute Antarctica cruise deal. Although I did not fulfill my goal to visit Antarctica, I experienced the beauty of nature around Ushuaia. Yes, the city has more than Antarctica cruise lines!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh, Mendoza, how I could express my love for you! In the middle of the mountains, Mendoza is South America’s top wine region, with fabulous hotels and world-class restaurants, and a vibrant local culture. While Mendoza is good for solo travelers, in my opinion, it’s better to come with your partner, your significant other, your love, your boo or bae, whatever you’d like to call the person, bring him/her to Mendoza please! A perfect place for honeymoon, anniversaries or just a relaxing and romantic vacation!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15z6m1h0db8lHphQHOpsyHONOy7-Ott4A"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Good-Life-in-Mendoza"><a href="#Good-Life-in-Mendoza" class="headerlink" title="Good Life in Mendoza"></a>Good Life in Mendoza</h1><p>Mendoza being my first stop in Argentina, set the tone of Argentina, a heaven with tasty asado (steak), wine and beautiful landscapes! As South America’s top wine region, with fabulous hotels and world-class restaurants, and a vibrant local culture, Mendoza appeals to travelers from all over the globe. The outer regions are as enticing as the city and wine country for adventurous types and wine lovers. From white water rafting at Rio Mendoza, mountain biking, hiking, to horseback riding and tranquil spas, there is something for everyone here. </p><p>Covered channels on practically every street throughout the city carry the water irrigate the city’s 50,000 or so magnificent trees everyday. The trees in Mendoza, as well as the parks, boulevards, plazas, and the acequias – or canals – that water them, are the most distinguishing architectural feature of the city. Walking around the streets in Mendoza you can easily forget that you are actually in a desert environment.</p><p>I did not do much in Mendoza but just wandering around the city plazas, spent an relaxing afternoon in <strong>General San Martino park</strong>, took a city walking tour and of course a winery tour and most importantly refueled myself with good asado, many of them for a very affordable price!</p><div class="note info">            <p>Note: Since March 2019, the Argentine peso continued to depreciate from ~37 ARS to 1 USD at the beginning of 2019 to ~60 ARS to 1 USD in November, 2019. Mendoza might not be that cheap to visit, but due to the inflation of Argentine peso, it made me felt everything was very affordable.</p>          </div><p>My apology for not taking enough photos of city of Mendoza. There is a saying in Mendoza <em>‘You have to get yourself drunk once or twice if not more in Mendoza!’</em>. I forgot who told me that sentence but I was tipsy almost everyday in Mendoza…Wine is SO CHEAP and sometimes free?! For most of the time, I ordered wine at restaurants, because they are cheaper than orange juice and beer?! I did not have the mood to take out my camera while wandering in the city. Google Mendoza and you will fall in love with the city immediately!  </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Xn1L-3ORfrnZAxs1UFvKFZYnCkoNkXdV"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13VxOhEF5E-cqCV8tyv8dKw90oiaxUNn0"><h1 id="Bike-Winery-Tour"><a href="#Bike-Winery-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Bike Winery Tour"></a>Bike Winery Tour</h1><p>There are over 1,500 <strong>wineries</strong> spread out through the three main wine regions - Lujan de Cuyo, Valle de Uco and Maipu - wide open spaces with nothing but vines, mountain grandeur and blue skies, and some of the best winery architecture in the world. But most wineries are so spaced out, all around Mendoza province, many are only accessible by either rental cars or taking an organized wine tasting tour. There are plenty choices for having a luxury wine tasting tour even with overnight stays at vineyard and gourmet meals!</p><p>While luxury and especially romantic vineyard tours were not for the lonely solo traveler Lan, there were several small clusters of wineries, close to Mendoza city center and perfectly accessible by bike! I did a self-guided bike winery tour in a rural district called Coquimbito in the <strong>Maipú</strong> Department of Mendoza Province.</p><p>I first took a bus to <a href="https://maipubikes.com/#!/-home/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maipu Bike Rental</a>, from there I got my bike (450 ARS ~ 6.5 USD for a day) and set off for my one-day winery bike tour.</p><p>Biking soberly on my way to the first winery in the tree-lined streets.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1CFcCylgz7qJEAwzlgeBHndW3CpTb5c9n"><p>There are around 10~15 wineries and one olive oil maker on this bike route. I do not know about your wine-drinking capacity my friends. Unless you are not tempted to sip some wine at the wineries, the more you visit the less sober you are…Not a big fan of wine but I enjoy drinking in general, I was only able to visit three wineries. Thank god, I was riding a bike not driving a car on my way back to the rental shop. But <strong>Cycling under the Influence (CUI)</strong> should be avoided as well…</p><p><a href="http://tempusalba.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tempus Alba</a> was my first stop. Known as a  modern boutique winery, I was told one of the best lunch stop for your day. Honestly, I was not very satisfied with the service there. I had to wait a long time for my order and wine to come… Anyway, this was the three wines I tasted and costed 150 ARS (~2.5 USD).</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1VZ9WeVxKjDTykZ8zsqa5WDnrN6tktzln"><p><a href="http://fincamevi.com.ar/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MEVI</a> was my favorite winery for the day! In my opinion, their balcony and restaurant provided a better view. But the menu only has a limited opinions for your lunch. I had three empanadas in their balcony and of course along with beautiful colors of wine :) Wine tasting at MEVI was 120 ARS (~2 USD). See who can say no with this view and low price for wine???</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1V4VrNh5TFiVqZIfJb8UBZNjAkf-Y09Fv"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15z6m1h0db8lHphQHOpsyHONOy7-Ott4A"><p>Last, I visited <a href="http://elcerno.com.ar/home/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vina El Cerno</a>, an old artisan winery and only makes organic wine. You can also have a winery tour here for 120 ARS (~ 2 USD). It was the only winery among the three I visited which provides winery tour. Very old fashioned artisan winery. But not much to see and the tour was only about half an hour. But good information were told about the winery, the wine making process and a cool visit to their wine cellar.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KYDKTE_6nIHXUYv2K0WozFFNaArR700_"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1WVDe9HpUGSxnprpOqy6UlbruoWJgmCvh"><p>Of course, a winery tour should end with a glass of wine for 95 ARS (~ 1.6 USD).</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=193jsZosMFowd4F_k6hIDcbq_s2vKBBEZ"><p>You may think that was the end of your bike tour? NO, NO, NO. Too young too naive…It was Mendoza! The rental bike shop offered HAPPY HOUR, meaning <strong>UNLIMITED FREE WINE</strong>? I guess no one should leave the winery tour sober! Yes, I reached 85% of my wine capacity that day and I was among the first 5 people who left the happy hour party.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15jqp5HjR5uXEe32Yg4aJ1kVTWp-YQIV0"><h2 id="Tips-for-Bike-Winery-Tour"><a href="#Tips-for-Bike-Winery-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Bike Winery Tour"></a>Tips for Bike Winery Tour</h2><p><strong>How to get there?</strong></p><p>The cheapest way to get to Coquimbito is by public buses. There are several bus lines from downtown to Coquimbito. Or you can take a taxi or rent a car. Although driving is not recommended, you need to be either very good at drinking wine or control of yourself not drinking too much, otherwise driving should be avoided. </p><p>If you decide to take the public transport, you need to get a magnetic Redbus card, which can be bought at most kiosks in the city. I was very lucky someone at my hostel generously borrowed me her Redbus card for a day. I believe the card only cost about a dollar and the bus tickets were very cheap as well under a dollar for a round trip.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11DMwMp8SG5LQ6wPfEuDMTa5vcXLOg5Hm"><p><strong>Bike Rental Shop</strong></p><p>There are three bike rental stores in the area. </p><ul><li><a href="https://maipubikes.com/#!/-home/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maipu Bike Rental</a></li><li>Mr. Hugo’s Bicycle Rental</li><li>Coquimbito Rental</li></ul><p>Maipu bike rental was recommended by the hostel and that was my choice. And the only bike shop with website. If interested, you can go their website for more information.</p><h1 id="Food-in-Mendoza"><a href="#Food-in-Mendoza" class="headerlink" title="Food in Mendoza"></a>Food in Mendoza</h1><p>How I love Mendoza and Argentina! Besides the wine, Mendoza is famous for its MEAT and probably one of the best region to go for the Argentine Asado! After months of craving for good meats (sorry, Bolivia and Chile), I was finally satisfied with the food on my trip again!</p><p>If you are a foodie, Mendoza will not let you down! There are plenty world-class restaurants, gourmet food and perfect steak! </p><h2 id="La-Florencia"><a href="#La-Florencia" class="headerlink" title="La Florencia"></a>La Florencia</h2><p>My favorite restaurant in Mendoza. May not be among the upscale restaurants, but the quality of food, service and atmosphere were good. And the best of all, the reasonable price on their menu. So how I liked it? I only stayed in Mendoza for 4 nights and 3 days, but I went there THREE TIMES!</p><p>The restaurant, outside and inside. It has outdoor seating as well. But I prefer indoor with AC…Mendoza spoiled me and made me lose my backpacker’s toughness…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1U9Fn59OPKSI2jDqmngjYuk4MRrL3Yj6A"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11nKXV0xXJzaKJmOE79fLOQuPARW_7DWh"><p>Meal One: 450gram of rib-eye and a small bottle of Malbec. Cost: 730 ARS <strong>(ONLY 10.5 USD?!)</strong></p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dngD1_DB5s0ZsIEi689YB5z7DqUbjekc"><p>Meal Two: Grilled rib with a bottle of beer (Beer was more expensive than cheaper wine options?!). Cost: 795 ARS (~ 11 USD)</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bAfg3sd_cewnoZrcKxfs-np5IO6nljSB"><p>Meal Three: Beef organ meat grilled plate with orange juice…It was a light lunch. You could tell that my drinking capabilities had been decreasing after days of stay in Mendoza. From wine, to beer and now to orange juice…Cost: 325 ARS (~ 5.5 USD)</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1rkiupaCvj80F96McCz9N-haMNjhnoeUa"><h2 id="All-You-Can-Eat"><a href="#All-You-Can-Eat" class="headerlink" title="All-You-Can-Eat"></a>All-You-Can-Eat</h2><p>Let me give you a NO-GO warning. The food was actually OK with a very reasonable price of 560 ARS (~ 9.5 USD) with a bottle of coke. However, I thought you should not waste your dinning opportunities in Mendoza on all-you-can-eat restaurant. You can definitely find better options. I didn’t know what I was thinking that night. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Up1U3WPqUu7EgUUJe-2H3ghgbl7iJyEZ"><h2 id="La-Lucia"><a href="#La-Lucia" class="headerlink" title="La Lucia"></a>La Lucia</h2><p>A fancier restaurant with a little bit pricy menu. For its location, decoration, service and food, I think the price was reasonable. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SRzvXtN_8dILU0BV5g7Ot3mXnH6AQ-xB"><p>Yeah, my 500 gram of ribeye with healthy veggie. Cost: 1275 ARS (~22 USD) I went to La Lucia on my last day in Mendoza. For my farewell, I ordered a full bottle of wine and finished it all ALONE. I believed that I proved myself and ended my Mendoza trip strong!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NSof_Q0HO2x2JGn9FOn-BCQ5P00Hcs-4"><h2 id="Endless-Hostel-Party"><a href="#Endless-Hostel-Party" class="headerlink" title="Endless Hostel Party"></a>Endless Hostel Party</h2><p>Choose your hotel wisely! Many of them are party hostels, which means all-night loud music, chatting, laughing until 3-4 a.m. For the first 3-nights, I was trapped in one of the party hostel. Nothing wrong with the travelers, the hostel owners and workers there, but I could NOT sleep at all. The last night, I moved to a hotel for a good night sleep before my early morning flight to Ushuaia. </p><p>So after my ‘STRONG’ finish of one bottle of wine, I encountered this…A backyard grill party?! The guys generously invited me to their party. I replied, ‘I just finished my dinner with a bottle of wine alone’. You know what? Here came the second slogan of Mendoza. <em>‘But it is a weekend. There is another level of getting yourself drunk for the weekend!’</em> </p><p>What could I say? I had to challenge the new level of my wine drinking capability!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AQbJKNp0bvDcu-nNdZs8uvRyOeA0VYGD"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19fGFTpyCe3wKe1GdUSJhAcP2V2_dA1_a"><h1 id="Log"><a href="#Log" class="headerlink" title="Log"></a>Log</h1><p>Mendoza stay November 13 to November 17, 2019.</p><p>Next stop:  Ushuaia, Argentina.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Santiago, the capital of Chile, is one of my most favorite cities in South America. The district I stayed and toured the most during my visit, has huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platanus_%C3%97_acerifolia" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London planetrees</a> (<strong>platanus  acerifolia, 法国梧桐</strong>) planted along the streets. The scent of these trees, especially at night, reminded me of my <strong>hometown Shanghai</strong> and that first moment of smelling the familiar scent clicked me with Santiago! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ObMcterE210C4ELumI8ZNsFbvcj8T8FC"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Santiago-A-City-Gripped-by-Protests-in-2019"><a href="#Santiago-A-City-Gripped-by-Protests-in-2019" class="headerlink" title="Santiago - A City Gripped by Protests in 2019"></a>Santiago - A City Gripped by Protests in 2019</h1><p> After 2019 Bolivian protests against president electoral protests, here I was in Santiago Chile, where the Chilean protests were even worse and much more violent compared to its neighbor Bolivia. Santiago, being the center of the storm, were pretty much destroyed. At the night of my arrival at 21:00, there was a curfew at 20:00 so basically no public transportation was available. I was supposed to take a subway from the airport shuttle station somewhere in the city center, but the subway was closed at 20:00. So I was desperately waiting at a bus stop on the major street (Avenida Providencia) carrying 23kg of my huge backpack and my computer back in the front. After a while, a very kind gentleman approached me asking where I was going and he told me nobody knew if the bus would come. ‘Why didn’t you take a taxi?’, the gentleman asked. I told him that my hostel was only 5 subway stops away and the taxi driver asked for a ridiculous price for it! He helped me to find a reasonable shared taxi around the bus stop! Thank you, Sir! So finally, I arrived my Santiago home, <a href="https://www.ajihostel.cl/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aji Hostel</a> before midnight.</p><p>I thought year of 2019 was pretty a bad year for traveling. Now in June 2020 looking back, the world was not that crazy at all in 2019! However, at that time, I was very disappointed visiting Chile at a bad time. There were strikes almost everywhere in the country. Public services were closed at its major cities, long distance bus services were on-and-off. Originally I planned to travel all the way down to the tip of Southern Chile. Due to the protest, I had to change my plan and decided to skip most of the southern Chilean spots. Also, during my four-day stay in Santiago, most of the parks, museums, stores and restaurants were closed. Armed police were packed along main streets with sirens on at nights. The demonstrators smashed shop windows, painted slogans on almost all beautiful historical buildings and statues in the downtown area. Protests were at the main plaza (Italian Plaza) every afternoon and night! The Italian Plaza happened to be on my way back to hostel after most of my city tours. So there I experienced after-effect of tear gas for the first time of my life. </p><p>The military vehicle with water cannons to push back the protesters at Italian Plaza in the afternoon. The night was even worse.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LXrV1G0WHwNVdyqNZ7atJu5iH8Lf3wT7"><p>The unfortunately <em>‘tattooed’</em> art museum and statues in downtown Santiago.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_JK9ipBXLVRXFrODhe0mgeg0vi1Rs6Ft"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nKYu6QtpKWA-agkmF_fyX7egeSqDw1Lb"><p>Stores with broken windows and front doors.

Protestors matched along main street (<strong>Avenida Providencia</strong>) and set fire to block the streets.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SB9mTlTVXK5xAyQhtGKdTAIrmF1K50Lx"><p>While the protest were against inequality and high living cost in Chile. OK, I understand this. However, what  was this related to ‘eating meat’?! I saw ‘Go Vegan’ slogan planted on the buildings every 2-5 blocks?! I had to hide the truth of being a meat lover in Santiago for the sake of my own safety?! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HExVtNTyyZuRDez-K-r609QM83myKjJu"><h1 id="Santiago-The-Hidden-Beauty-during-The-Protests"><a href="#Santiago-The-Hidden-Beauty-during-The-Protests" class="headerlink" title="Santiago - The Hidden Beauty during The Protests"></a>Santiago - The Hidden Beauty during The Protests</h1><p>Although things were very crazy in Santiago, I was still able to explore some of its charm and beauty.</p><h2 id="Barrio-Manuel-Montt"><a href="#Barrio-Manuel-Montt" class="headerlink" title="Barrio Manuel Montt"></a>Barrio Manuel Montt</h2><p>My hostel was in Barrio Manuel Montt, a very beautiful district with London planetrees lined streets, beautiful historical buildings, fancy bars and restaurants. After a quick shower, I was ready for a late-night food hunting at 0:30 a.m. Yes, I knew it sounded crazy but I was starving and the front desk told me the neighborhood was safe from the protests and there should be something open at the nightlife area which was only minutes away!</p><p>So there I was on the quiet street with dimmed streets lights. Suddenly, I was hit by a familiar scent sent by the cool breeze. I did not know what scent was that but it made me so happy and reminded me walking in the <strong>French colony district in Shanghai</strong> (if you never visit Shanghai, this district should be on the top of your Shanghai itinerary!!!) in the cool summer night! Immediately, I wanted a drink! Friends, I seldom drank on my travel for safety concerns but still I wanted a <strong>DRINK</strong> so badly!!!</p><p>Fortunately, the bars were still open! So after a short stop at a Chilean fast food restaurant. I found myself a fancy bar sipping a beer of the night on their rooftop with of course good music! The one of the best moments in Chile! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10Ojpyd_8QvjAVxbSoSrjgFoNFlgvZIiq"><p>The next day, I figured out what made the familiar scent of home? That was the <strong>London planetrees</strong>! It had been years since I left those old friends! They were everywhere around my hostel! Later I found, those trees were planted in many districts of the city. I indulged myself in the pleasant scent of London planetrees in Santiago! This was probably the reason I was in love with the city. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GUTPXY9NfkHr9XixqcsGafufCmbNXOgT"><h2 id="Santiago-Metropolitan-Park"><a href="#Santiago-Metropolitan-Park" class="headerlink" title="Santiago Metropolitan Park"></a>Santiago Metropolitan Park</h2><blockquote><p>The Santiago Metropolitan Park is located between four communes of Santiago – Huechuraba, Providencia, Recoleta and Vitacura – and covers around 722 hectares, making it the largest urban park in Chile and one of the largest in the world. It also maintains 16 Urban Parks distributed throughout 13 communes in Santiago, a total area of almost 150.1 hectares. </p></blockquote><p>Although during the protests, most of museums and parks were closed. Nobody was certain if anything was open or closed. The only way to find it out was just go there! I was very lucky to be able to visit Santiago Metropolitan Park on a peaceful Sunday morning. It was a great self-guided city tour day. </p><h3 id="Chilean-National-Zoo"><a href="#Chilean-National-Zoo" class="headerlink" title="Chilean National Zoo"></a>Chilean National Zoo</h3><p>My first stop of the day was the <a href="https://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chilean National Zoo</a>, a home to thousands of animals. Although I had opportunities observing many wild animals during my South American trip, this zoo was still wroth of visiting and I had a lot of fun there.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Jje6mKHQM4mCF79bzqOZDJcQcHVsvr7j"><p>After the Uyuni tour, I still enjoyed visiting the elegant (but a little stinky) flamingos.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yHQwgVT_U-qt0zruC417Lvdy81Em6bCJ"><p>Other selected beautiful and cute animals at the zoo.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Pa0CGHCtirqFIrPtvBBy-45ExlyEzXwB"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1u5AIpK4FzkfjYEZ96dMhOa9uZ2nOOBuX"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GqzGj50_katw35BBXFnxnjC0yQyNMO5t"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1JMwQOg_K7OZ11BsXfNiiTdPz5SDkKGur"><h3 id="Sanctuary-on-San-Cristobal-Hill"><a href="#Sanctuary-on-San-Cristobal-Hill" class="headerlink" title="Sanctuary on San Cristóbal Hill"></a>Sanctuary on San Cristóbal Hill</h3><p>Located on the top of <strong>Cerro San Cristóbal</strong>, there locates the white statue of the Virgen de la Inmaculada Concepción and a small chapel for praying.</p><p>I decided to take a special mode of transport, <strong>Funicular train</strong>, from the zoo to get to the top of the hill.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1PG_8mZD9ZXirRZj6hwm1-WJbslp77LnG"><p>This was the view from the <strong>Funicular train</strong>.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1v5nIolcYgPX5M51k1TxgfTkk6qzW7qzc"><p>At the top of the hill, there was some religious event going on.

I decided to take a hike back. There were lots of people biking along the road, I meant serious bikers with all professional equipment and their fancy road bikes. </p><p>On the way down, you will be able to have a good panoramic view of the city. In the center of the photo is the Gran Torre Santiago, the tallest building in Latin America! You can also visit there. I was not interested in going to tall modern buildings rather the mountains, so I did not visit there.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ObMcterE210C4ELumI8ZNsFbvcj8T8FC"><p>I also had the opportunities passing through several other parks, fancy neighborhoods and part of Providencia district on my way back to the hostel. The little hike/walk was from the top of Cerro San Cristóbal, was a total of only 4.5 km.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1BwaV5DFyRRKm48uGQhi3-ZtPCQcwVccD"><h2 id="Santiago-City-Walking-Tour"><a href="#Santiago-City-Walking-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Santiago City Walking Tour"></a>Santiago City Walking Tour</h2><p>In most of tourist cities, you will find ‘free’ city walk tours (not really free, you pay a tip at the end of the tour). I think it is a great way to explore the city from a little bit of locals’ eye and learn some history and information of the city. So I signed up my city tour with <a href="https://tours4tips.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tours4Tips</a>.</p><p>Again, due to the situation (I mean the protests), we had an uncommon walking itinerary around Santiago downtown.</p><p>First, we visited Valpo, a neighborhood with beautiful street arts! Most of the houses, bars and restaurants were decorated with unique street arts on their buildings. Another chic neighborhood for nightlife.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1BjcITtg4nOj5ZTihEY52LPsi6wNL-mc5"><p>Then we continued to neighborhood at the foot of <strong>Cerro San Cristóbal</strong>. Peaceful streets with plenty of bars and restaurants. Santiago seems to be a city good for nightlife, I mean during non-protest times.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1eZOxxKZp0gcNaaF4IZZmf_TugUoDZZUI"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1joCWZte6ryfRj3s9YmTHZbwbG5Srw0EJ"><p><strong>Santa Filomena church</strong> in Korean neighborhood (I don’t know exactly if this is a Korean town, but there are lots of Korean grocery stores and restaurants around)? I planned to come back for a Korean dinner, however it was a little bit far from my hostel and did not make it that night. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14D0_nkSeYlUCql1gPERRz3RKjSwj_jTn"><p>Then we continued to <strong>Mercado la Vega</strong>, a huge market for fresh veggie, fruits, flowers and a BIG market food courts for locals. We by-passed a Chinatown. Yes, after the Korean town, it’s time for Chinese friends!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IpWwKxKJyf34HdDUNOPogeYzVIbGwogL"><p>Then the busy real market, with a handsome veggie guard, the cute market cat :)</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qsHOYrdiKzZO_lbyBPzPnyzW6WTrQyag"><p>And finally, I learnt the correct Spanish spelling of a very delicious fruit in South America, <strong>chirimoya</strong>!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=100Tmtrhb0Tr7c2Dks0yDH_ZmLP0V02bu"><p>The tour ended at <strong>Mercado Central</strong>, a seafood market. But mostly for tourists and filled with seafood restaurants with waiters holding the menu searching for their potential customers.  The building architecture was nice to visit. While Chile’s seafood industry ranked <strong>the sixth largest in the world</strong>, the seafood market was so tiny.. Later after the tour, I came back for a taste of Chilean seafood meal, again very disappointed. The fish was very fresh but the taste was just OK… Um, maybe I was at a wrong place for seafood tasting.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vUx_dQWa2KuibmeY71nMJEYd72gaCvUl"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NnQNYWRGcd5lAriGxzGiOnOrX56cf6aq"><p>And the touristic seafood restaurant at <strong>Mercado Central</strong>.

But this one, <a href="https://www.ajihostel.cl/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aji Hostel</a>, was so special! <strong>Breakfast and dinner</strong> are included?! Also, it was located one block away from the subway station on <strong>Avenida Providencia</strong> and close to most of the tourist spots. Lastly, its neighborhood was very quiet and nice, with London planetree everywhere! Sorry for my biased opinion here.</p><p>For my four-night stay at a 4-bed female room with ensuite bathroom, it only costed me about 40 USD in total with breakfast and dinner included! A lovely old-house painted pinky was my hostel in Santiago.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1s7K-7onxMb_aQyZk-m6633nbL2b9ZbaW"><p>While the facilities were not that modern, it was clean and comfy.

      &lt;p&gt;Santiago, the capital of Chile, is one of my most favorite cities in South America. The district I stayed and toured the most during my visit, has huge &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platanus_%C3%97_acerifolia&quot; rel=&quot;external nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;London planetrees&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;platanus  acerifolia, 法国梧桐&lt;/strong&gt;) planted along the streets. The scent of these trees, especially at night, reminded me of my &lt;strong&gt;hometown Shanghai&lt;/strong&gt; and that first moment of smelling the familiar scent clicked me with Santiago! &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the north of Chile, <strong>a small adobe and peaceful village</strong>: is San Pedro de Atacama. If you are like me, never heard of this small town, put it on your bucket list of South America trip first. Then, continue to read my story of this lovely tourist town! It will probably completely blew your mind!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1faISTfAn6ODzI9m4o-mnbRGD7I7U6eK0"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="San-Pedro-de-Atacama"><a href="#San-Pedro-de-Atacama" class="headerlink" title="San Pedro de Atacama"></a>San Pedro de Atacama</h1><h2 id="Some-General-Information"><a href="#Some-General-Information" class="headerlink" title="Some General Information"></a>Some General Information</h2><ol><li><strong>San Pedro de Atacama</strong> locates in the north of Chile and 98 kilometers from Calama (the nearest city with airport). It is a base for travelers who want to explore Atacama Desert and its surroundings.</li><li>The Atacama Desert spans about 41,000 square miles. That’s somewhere between the size of Tennessee (41,220) and Ohio (40, 953). It’s over 600 miles long, but only about 60 miles wide.</li><li>The Atacama is the driest non-polar place on the planet (the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are the driest). The average rainfall in Atacama is less than an inch a year, even in the wettest spots.</li></ol><h2 id="San-Pedro-the-Lovely-Adobe-Tourist-Town"><a href="#San-Pedro-the-Lovely-Adobe-Tourist-Town" class="headerlink" title="San Pedro - the Lovely Adobe Tourist Town"></a>San Pedro - the Lovely Adobe Tourist Town</h2><p>I showed up to San Pedro de Atacama at the end of my 3-day Salar de Uyuni tour. I was exhausted and honestly did not feel like exploring a new place. The only reason I even stopped through San Pedro was because of its convenient proximity to the airport in Calama, which could get me to my next stop of my South American trip, Santiago for cheap. I found myself a hostel and booked 2 nights there planning to just to relax before flying to Santiago. However, latter I found out this magical town totally blew my mind! This area is one of the most exciting places to visit in Chile with so much to offer from its incredible landscapes, saline lakes, high-altitude geysers, softly smoking volcanoes, lunar rock formations, tons of outdoor activities to explore and rows and rows of restaurants and bars! It has really all for everyone. </p><p>The town’s streets are dirt, and its houses adobe. The streets are occupied with restaurants, cafe, bar, craft stores and tour agencies. Its central area is very tiny but very peaceful and enjoyable to walk around. Probably have some drinks along the way to avoid the deadly afternoon sunlight. My friends from Phoenix, you know what I am talking about!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NO61hRHc3H1a75HwEFLUcUScqN_fCqZe"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18q6XBRoTvq4dcxrsQcQ5wljpUEYzjB88"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fTXwpIn3oMFWVeU7D3nxqcjbfAw7MIg6"><h2 id="A-Millionaire-in-Chile"><a href="#A-Millionaire-in-Chile" class="headerlink" title="A Millionaire in Chile"></a>A Millionaire in Chile</h2><p>Let us be straight. Chile is an <strong>expensive</strong> country for travelers, especially for budget backpackers like me. San Pedro is even above the Chilean standard! Maybe to emphasis the feeling of being expensive or to make you feel rich, they have HUGE bills…The exchange rate is 1 USD to ~815 Chilean pesos. So the first day I exchanged 300 USD dollars in turn I got a quarter of a million cash in my wallet?! Poor me, I was only able to count within 1000 in Spanish. I thought that was enough for me and proved I was wrong!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1S_Mg4TT-dGTlBrQtTR7LMu-KCrxu9hRP"><h1 id="Tours-and-Activities"><a href="#Tours-and-Activities" class="headerlink" title="Tours and Activities"></a>Tours and Activities</h1><p>There are so much to do from San Pedro, from Atacama desert  saline lakes, high-altitude geysers, softly smoking volcanoes, lunar rock formations to Salar de Uyuni. For outdoor adventurers, you can go sandboarding, 4×4 quads rides, mountain/desert biking, hot air balloon tour etc. For independent travelers, you can rent a car and have your own adventures in the area. Or for layback travelers, there are plenty of tour agencies for you as well.</p><p>Coming from Salar de Uyuni, I was done with salt flats, colorful lagoons, and geysers. Also, I did not want to torture myself under the deadly sunlight hiking/biking in the area. Yes, I am an Asian vampire! So I signed up for three guided tours in the area. All of them turn out to be <strong>SPLENDID</strong>!</p><h2 id="Valle-de-la-Luna"><a href="#Valle-de-la-Luna" class="headerlink" title="Valle de la Luna"></a>Valle de la Luna</h2><p>Remember the Valle de la Luna park in La Paz? Compared to this moon valley in San Pedro, La Paz’s park is just a toy!</p><blockquote><p>Valle de la Luna Chile is located in the heart of the Cordillera de la Sal (Salt Mountain Range) in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. The valley includes 87,000 square miles (140,000 square km) of protected land under Los Flamencos National Reserve.</p><p>Known as Moon Valley in English, the valley gets its name from its otherworldly rocky environment. Wind and ancient water erosion over thousands of years have molded the salt, sand, and clay into strange formations that look like the surface of the moon. These rock formations combined with giant sand dunes make you feel as if you are not on planet Earth.</p></blockquote><p>This was a half-day tour. We set off at 3:00 p.m to the Moon Valley! With a short-ride, we were dropped off at our first stop, the <strong>Big Dune</strong> trailhead! Although it was just a total of ~3km distance for round trip, it was somewhat difficult to finish it in a hour! You are hiking in the desert in a very hot weather! But the views were wonderful! OK, again, friends from Arizona, compared to landscapes in Arizona and Utah, also latter to Sarah, it was not that <strong>UTTERLY STUNNING</strong>. It was my first time to climb and see such a big sand dune. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1z3SbdD3Xmn76WzHXK1GivY3HrCrT_Emi"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GSBdf1mGYclTb9Y-y2iOUubokSXCMF69"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LKIRkw7XudX5E9Br-AjMMXotqRZN3S3D"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_InJqvO8lo6X61rkyZjreOo51B3hRQl0"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bnSfpgyIo5NWGpqD3f3EmWbXRH7x_xL5"><p>After the big dune, we stopped at several other view points in the moon valley.

There lays a series of dazzling blue lagoons surrounded by shimmering crystals of salt. <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOUR!!!</strong></p><p>It was another half-day tour started at 2:00 p.m. After an hour of driving on curvy and unpaved roads, we arrived the entry of the park, where we had the chance to change our swimming suits for the float! Then we followed the track that will take us by the lagoons that form this wonderful landscape.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fO7CTg8r6ZpAMlH0T8mrRKh7Hsk_A7Jv"><p>The trek is completely made of salt, though looks like walking on the sandy beach.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mMSnG9LnO_8OsIhy0SyfHhIa8r7F-Hbd"><p>The beautiful colors of the lagoon and crystals of salt!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1no9dd2SrQmabkrvuhyd4GukdgFdjTTZ6"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Rq7lnGikdusUkR__ToDNNgVzNnrN09ZB"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Wie2vFzsMnXnVmuWjhALDRqZksyfz6hP"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1zKu1hcCFgDAPBsQ-2ETIxLIkbaOCDtyP"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11sEpwBg7Y8osevyysQqXH-waCK-eBhPm"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZTulJizB19EWOLsZWtbS3Rcg_skk4FcG"><p>Among the seven lagoons, you can go swim, or to be more actuate, <strong>FLOAT</strong> in two of the lagoons. Yes, <strong>FLOAT</strong>! The amount of salt in the water (400 grams per liter) creates the flotation effect like the <strong>Dead Sea</strong>. The water is relatively cold, at about 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), but in the burning desert Sun, it feels refreshing. First check out the beach!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dBqltnvuWy7iHHMsqc52fCk3tK2UDRdo"><p>Among seven lagoons, only first and last are allowed to swim. Hold your instinct plunging into the first lagoon. The last one is much bigger and fun to swim! Also, you can take your chance for the first lagoon on your way back. You do not want to wear the salt layer on your entire body after the float and walk back and forth the trail. So here we come the floating time!</p><p>The much smaller first pool:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OaM6cTb1o76AA5ZPoYnI1U964g2OIRHt"><p>The bigger last pool:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18n0xEbn5C6YgQdbN_GtbCIs66B6XztxZ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1u_gSPz1X6DW5Jf2Ah_FFSJD4nC-NlsUK"><p>And this is the extra salt layer on the skin all of your body after the float!

If stargazing is on your bucket list, plan your days in advance. <strong>Avoid full moon</strong>! Many stargazing tour do not operate for a six day period around the full moon. And according to my guide, the best time is new moon in winter. But it will be freezingly cold at night there!</p><p>So there are lots of agencies offering stargazing tour in San Pedro. The best is <a href="https://www.spaceobs.com/en/Services/Star-Tours" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SPACE</a>. They have the largest park of telescopes of any public observatory in south America (between 20 and 72cm diameter). If you want to take their tour, you’d better to book online in advance. Their tours, especially English tours, are fully booked <strong>EVERYDAY</strong>! Reservations are normally made online or at their office in San Pedro days/weeks in advance. Without reservation, your only chance will be visit their office after 3 p.m. to see if there is any open seats without payment for that day. I went there at least twice and luckily got one spot for the English tour on their last operation day before November’s full moon!</p><p>Why they are so popular? Check out their HUGE telescopes!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15nH5R7y3b9-AMv2It3zfmVdtk1b6bTK9"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HtASfFuo2BOc4oxcZL2R0YxwvQ4KVUUK"><p>They have about 15 telescopes in the observatory. Although that night moon was very bright, I saw many stars including the Saturn with its rings, the most brilliant planet, Venus in the night sky, couple of star clouds. And I took a picture with my camera of moon using one of their telescope!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10VShcPk0Q1fqjK3iMy_OB3GaAs7z_UXC"><h2 id="Extra-Information-on-Tours-in-San-Pedro"><a href="#Extra-Information-on-Tours-in-San-Pedro" class="headerlink" title="Extra Information on Tours in San Pedro"></a>Extra Information on Tours in San Pedro</h2><h3 id="Costs"><a href="#Costs" class="headerlink" title="Costs"></a>Costs</h3><ul><li>Lagunas Escondidas: 20,000 CLP (~24.5 USD) ~6h tour time, transport, entrance ticket, and picnic included</li><li>Valley de La Luna: 10,000 CLP (~12 USD) ~5h tour time, transport and entrance ticket included</li><li>Stargazing with SPACE: 25,000 CLP (~30 USD) for 2.5-hour tour everything included</li></ul><h3 id="Other-Tours"><a href="#Other-Tours" class="headerlink" title="Other Tours"></a>Other Tours</h3><p>For Valley de La Luna and Death Valley, you can rent a bike and have your own independent tour.

For my personal tastes, I did not really enjoyed the Chilean food :( In my opinion, even worse than Bolivian food, since the price was SO HIGH compared to other South American countries, almost close to eating out in the U.S. For the price I paid, I was not satisfied with the taste. Most of the dishes were quite bland and all pork had boar taint?! Why can’t you Chileans import some meat from Argentina and also learn how to cook meat from them?! Oh, one good thing was finally the Chilean rice tasted like real rice not the plastic ones!</p><p>While I had my own reserved opinions on their food and restaurants, many tourists seem to enjoy the food. Mostly importantly, at least they all have very good atmosphere! Things got even worse as I continued traveling in Chile.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Salar de Uyuni, the world largest salt flat, is probably one of the top tourist locations in South America! You may consider it to be the nature’s art studio. Photographers flock here to capture the unique landscape, from the famous ‘mirror effect’ during the rain season or the stunning octagonal salt formations in the dry season, the colorful lagoons, the flocks of flamingos, geysers, unique rock formations, and deserts! You name it there you have them all!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10wL-99kRJGChxRapXk7lJhZahveEWstv"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Salar-de-Uyuni-General-Information"><a href="#Salar-de-Uyuni-General-Information" class="headerlink" title="Salar de Uyuni - General Information"></a>Salar de Uyuni - General Information</h1><p>There are only two seasons in Salar de Uyuni, the dry and the wet season! Both provide stunning view and experience. But if you are there for the ‘mirror effect’, you need to go somewhere between December to April. According to my tour guide, the best time is probably February.</p><p>Now let’s talk about where do you want to start your tour. There are three options:</p><ul><li><strong>Uyuni, Bolivia</strong>: The most popular starting point for salt flats tours. </li><li><strong>San Pedro de Atacama, Chile</strong>: this option usually means a three-day tour. The agency drives travelers to the Chilean-Bolivian border and hands the tour over to a Bolivian tour operator. </li><li><strong>Tupiza, Bolivia:</strong> a less popular starting point, but some travelers told me that if you start from here, you will hit the popular spots during different time of day, which means no crowds around you. Tour operators offer four-day tours from Tupiza, with a visit to Salar de Uyuni on the last day.</li></ul><h1 id="City-of-Uyuni-Find-Your-Tour-Agency"><a href="#City-of-Uyuni-Find-Your-Tour-Agency" class="headerlink" title="City of Uyuni - Find Your Tour Agency"></a>City of Uyuni - Find Your Tour Agency</h1><p>My journey to the Salar de Uyuni started with a night bus that brought me to the sleepy little town of Uyuni in November, which is the dry season. My bus dropped me off at some random street in a cold and dark morning of 5 a.m. I knew that there really isn’t anything to do in this town. So I decided not to stay an extra day in this tiny town but try my luck and find my tour starting at the same day. Being so early in the morning, no travel agencies were open so I followed a group of travelers to a restaurant for breakfast, WiFi and a warm place to spend couple of hours there.</p><p>At around 7:30 a.m., Uyuni wakes up. So I packed everything and started off my search for the tour agency. There is really no need to book your tour in advance since there are plenty of tour agencies operate tours to the salt flats. You will definitely a better deal here for the cheaper tours. </p><p><strong>Types of Tour Available from Uyuni</strong></p><ul><li>One Day Salar de Uyuni Tour: only visit the salt flat. I was here for more of course</li><li><strong>Three Day Tour</strong>: this was the one I chose. With this tour, you will not only visit the salt flat, but the colorful lagoons, the volcanos, the deserts etc., basically almost everything around. You also have an option to end your tour in San Pedro de Atacama, Chile or return back to Uyuni.</li><li>Four Day Tour: Almost the same itinerary, with extra one day trek to <strong>Tunupa Volcano</strong>. Not another mountain climbing for me. No, thank you!</li><li>Sunrise/Sunset at Salt Flat: if you have the three or four day tour, you will view the sunset at the salt flat.</li><li><strong>Stargazing Tour at Salt Flat</strong>: I heard this tour is AMAZING! If I had knew it, I would love to take this tour. The only problem is that you may need to stay in Uyuni for an extra day without anything to do. Most of the hostels seem not that cozy :(</li></ul><p>Let me say more about the <strong>three day tour</strong>. All tour agencies operate this itinerary more or less on the same route. So basically, you will spend 3 days on a 4-by-4 jeep with one driver as your guide as well, and total of six travelers. The seats will be front passenger seat, second row of 3 passengers, and backrow for 2 other passengers. During the trip, everybody rotates the seats. The driving time will take up to 75% of the day with stoppings at various view points. That’s it for all shared tours. Of course, if you are willing to pay more for comfort and customized itinerary, you can book for a private tour.</p><p>The differences among the tour agencies and the prices are the following:</p><ul><li>Spanish/English Guide (Spanish guide is much cheaper than English guide. But really, I don’t think it makes a huge difference if you can speak some Spanish.)</li><li>Accommodation</li><li>Meals (may not be that much differences)</li><li>Extra Service </li></ul><p>As of November 2019, the cost for the shared 3-day tour ranges from 720 BS to 1320 BS (~ 105 - 190 USD). This price range is for ending the tour in <strong>San Pedro Atacama, Chile</strong>, which is approximately 10 USD more than returning back to Uyuni. The extra cost is for the bus transfer from the border to San Pedro Atacama, Chile.</p><p>I finally booked my tour with <a href="http://quechuaconnection4wd.com/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quechaua Connection</a> for 1320 BS. Yes, the most expensive tour agency! After shopping around, I felt that I came all the way to it and do not want to have a bad experience for saving extra 80 bucks or so. Fixed price as advertised on their website. No negotiation is allowed but they do not add travelers from other agencies. If the vehicle is not full, they will just start off with less people. For my experience, our vehicle only have five travelers for six-seat capacity, which gives us more comfort.</p><p>There are some extra services came with the high price:</p><ul><li><strong>Bike ride on the salt flat.</strong> Quechaua Connection is <strong>the only tour agency</strong> provides this unique experience.</li><li><strong>Hot spring under the moon.</strong> So the thermal spring is a common stop for the 3-day tour. Given the limited accommodation hostels around the hot spring, most tour agencies arrange their second night stay in villages near the hot spring and visit the spot early in the morning on the last day. This not only requires you to get up really early like 5 a.m. but also only gives you limited time at the spring like an hour or less.  If your over-night stay is located in the hot spring town, it means that you can enjoy it with fewer people under moon and stay there as long as you like! Only a few tour agencies have hostel arrangements at the hot spring. If this is something you would like, double check with your tour agency!</li><li>Sleeping bags provided. While other tour agency may require extra money for renting a sleeping bag, you will have your own sleep bag with Quechaua Connection. However, I do not think it was necessary. Maybe for the second night only, since second night accommodation was a very very basic lodge.</li><li>Better meals and hostels? I am not sure. We were provided with plenty of food and taste was OK. Our last dinner, there were wine provide but not good wine. Without comparison to other travelers, I have no idea on how much better compared with other tour agencies. The first night, I had a double room with private bathroom for my own. Yes, you can take a shower there! The second night, since we were very further into the remote parts, I guess no agency would be able to provide you with good hostel. We had a dorm room for 6 people, mixed gender. Very very basic hostel.</li><li>English Speaking Guide, again, I don’t really think this is necessary since at that time, Yo hablo poco español! </li></ul><p>For those who are interested, there are a list of tour agencies with good online review at Uyuni:</p><ul><li><a href="http://quechuaconnection4wd.com/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quechaua Connection</a>, the one I chose. Very good but not cheap.</li><li><a href="http://redplanetexpedition.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Red Planet</a>, another tour agency at higher price range with good review.</li><li><a href="https://www.andes-salt-uyuni.com.bo/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andes Salt Expedition</a>, the cheaper choice. Probably you can find Spanish tour for 800 BS or English tour for about 1000 BS. </li><li>Plenty of no name, no review tour agencies along the main street in the city of Uyuni, where you would be able to bargain for a cheaper deal like around 700 BS for 3-day Spanish guide.</li></ul><p><strong>Tip: If possible, pay with cash. While credit card is also allowed, there will be 5% charge on top of the tour cost for most of the agencies.</strong></p><h1 id="My-3-Day-Salar-de-Uyuni-Tour"><a href="#My-3-Day-Salar-de-Uyuni-Tour" class="headerlink" title="My 3-Day Salar de Uyuni Tour"></a>My 3-Day Salar de Uyuni Tour</h1><p>So I booked my tour on the day of my arrival at around 9:30 a.m. with <a href="http://quechuaconnection4wd.com/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quechaua Connection</a>.

While I enjoy traveling alone for the freedom, most people come for taking crazy perspective photos on the salt flat, with lovers, friends or families. You need to have someone to take photos for you and with you! Otherwise, check for my pity photos alone or with our food for dinner…Even my guide felt kind of sympathy for me.</p>          </div><p>As I said, being a solo traveler is difficult on salt flat especially when it came to photo time!!! We stopped at the salt flat for about 45-minute for taking photos. OK, friends, people came here with photo designs in mind and brought all kinds of toys, gadgets for their photo! How prepared they are! This was the scene for the photo studio, everybody seemed to be very busy. Please do not get me wrong. I had a wonderful group of ten travelers and our two guides were fantastic. All photos of me below were taken either by other travelers or by our guide. Thank you all!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10KaK4Gh33BUXR0c8TimA3kYixxsh9L3-"><p>And this was me, enjoying my peaceful ZEN time alone on the salt flat.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IIglFzQebU0bawmumRNZwD0zV8ahWYCU"><p>Our two guides were also busy with helping with the setup and taking photos for our group, remember, a family of five, a couple and two sisters. I was totally fine having my own time. But at the end of the photo time, my guides probably felt sympathy for my loneliness.

If you know me, you would probably know I am a huge fan of hot spring! After our dinner, we walked to the hot spring. It was nothing fancy like Japanese hot spring, but it is all nature and you will enjoy it under the moon!</p><p>Although there were fewer people (15 - 20 people) at the pool, they all came with lovers, friends or families. People were joking, drinking or chatting together. So here I was alone having my ZEN time at the corner of the pool. My kind guide found me. With a soft heart, he invited me to the hidden local pool which was just couple of steps away but kinda of difficult to locate in the dark if you are not local. I guess that was my best treat of being a solo traveler during this tour! This pool was only for local people which means much quieter and less people here. Thanks to my Spanish lessons in Sucre, I chatted with several locals in Spanish. They even shared some mineral mud from the geysers for facial treatment! Now it became a high-end spa experience! I really enjoyed it and stayed there for about 2-hours! Highly recommend!!!</p><h2 id="Day-3"><a href="#Day-3" class="headerlink" title="Day 3"></a>Day 3</h2><p>After breakfast, we departed at 7 a.m. on our last day. On our way out, I saw crowds of people from other tour agencies to have their dip in the hot spring. The last day was a short day for those who choose to continue to Chile. You would be dropped off at the border at around 11 a.m. If you choose to return to Uyuni, then probably you would stop by several extra view points and get back to Uyuni at around 5 p.m.</p><p>On our way to the Bolivian-Chilean border, we stopped at Dali desert and one or two lagoons.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1E0UpAVwxPysYQHeanTZkW6IRor8LEr5I"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pUauD5on1kvBVgoG2T0vtWCpi0YhGAQO"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YtaXDbgHYs3amIWLb-ARiN-q7hFuBaoO"><h3 id="Crossing-Bolivian-Chilean-Border"><a href="#Crossing-Bolivian-Chilean-Border" class="headerlink" title="Crossing Bolivian-Chilean Border"></a>Crossing Bolivian-Chilean Border</h3><p>At noon, we arrived at the border.

Oh, by the way, after another 15-minute ride, we arrived the Chilean border control point, where all travelers are required to get all luggage off the bus. You need to open each and every bag and pockets to have them hand-checked by the Chilean border control officer. This was the most restricted check I had in South America!

      &lt;p&gt;Salar de Uyuni, the world largest salt flat, is probably one of the top tourist locations in South America! You may consider it to be the nature’s art studio. Photographers flock here to capture the unique landscape, from the famous ‘mirror effect’ during the rain season or the stunning octagonal salt formations in the dry season, the colorful lagoons, the flocks of flamingos, geysers, unique rock formations, and deserts! You name it there you have them all!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sucre is the white city of Bolivia and it is one of the best city to have some Spanish lessons not only for its budget friendly tuitions but also for the layback life-style in Sucre. However, I arrived at the wrong time. Several days after my arrival, Bolivia experienced the biggest protests in decades and basically turned the country to chaos…What an experience!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dYjgJXIlhUnwMLhQzhOqmFlZAdm6ENKT"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="My-First-Peaceful-Weekend-at-Sucre"><a href="#My-First-Peaceful-Weekend-at-Sucre" class="headerlink" title="My First Peaceful Weekend at Sucre"></a>My First Peaceful Weekend at Sucre</h1><p>I was sold by the Google search on other travelers’ blogs and reviews on this white city of Bolivia. White washed colonial buildings, bell towers and rooftop terraces, and plenty of good and ‘cheap’ Spanish school options were the filled on my screen. Without any hesitations, here I was.</p><p>After another 11-hour overnight comfortable bus ride, I arrived Sucre at 6 a.m.. I directly went to my Sucre home ‘<a href="https://spanish-friends-school.webself.net/spanishfriends" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spanish Friends Hostel</a>‘. The Gavi the owner helped me to check in early, get my room ready, and even I had the breakfast there! The hostel was not high-end or even mid-end just very basic but clean, located only blocks away from the main plaza and most importantly very quiet! It is the best place if you want to have some rest and study in Sucre, not a party hostel! Except my 4-night home-stay at a local Sucre family, I stayed at this hostel for 10+ days and made some friends there. We went out for lunches almost everyday. Highly recommend this hostel! </p><p>The very first morning, I spent my time visiting several Spanish schools and decided to enroll at Sucre Spanish School. Once returned to my hostel, Gavi invited me to the local fish market with her friends. Oh my, I am not a fan of fish, but this was probably the best meal I had in Bolivia! And actually, I went there again on my last day in Sucre! Huge and delicious grilled fish only for 35 Bs!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jDMvFhBaUSb2NgBL2tNQjJy1cAaHQ6oJ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lf9Pj2LqWQ4_oV3uWoYyyGihI0gGgfgq"><p>The second day was Sunday and the weekend was for Bolivian presidential election weekend. In Bolivia, by law every one is required to vote. So the city was basically all closed for election voting. Actually, the city was almost closed for my entire stay at Sucre due to the 2019 Bolivian protests against election fraud…But that Sunday, I really enjoyed the peaceful Sucre downtown without any traffic, blue sky and while colonial buildings.</p><p>Walking uphill from the center of town, my first stop was <strong>La Recoleta</strong>, a popular gathering place and lookout point in Sucre. Yes, uphill again! Compared to La Paz, Sucre is flatter but still Sucre is located in a valley surrounded by low mountains which means hiking in the city again…</p> <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19HPgi3KVmw_Ar-YH89t0wQqlAVnk3pNW"><p>But its views are worth the effort!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1kaPKkuCGL2Urh2NQeDHxkk0VOg2yN7HZ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1q9N-bTQlRCyq8SyBAoKTnaIZxR7gfrsM"><p>For there, I continued my mountain hiking to even higher lookout point from <strong>La Recoleta</strong>. Up in the mountain, there is a Jesus Christ tower and surrounding views for the panoramic view of the city. Um, the view is better at the <strong>La Recoleta</strong> to be honest. But if you don’t mind the effort, it was just about 45-minute walking up the hill, not a difficult trail at all!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wclD-GfPvD3XfSqaJCQp7DYuXjVljqA5"><p>Coming down to the hills, I toured around <strong>Plaza 25 de Mayo</strong> , the city’s main square and <strong>Parque Bolivar</strong>. Plaza 25 de Mayo is surrounded by some of the city’s most important buildings including the Cathedral, Liberty House and State Government Building. Parque Bolivia is a long, tree-lined park across from the Supreme Court and is a quiet place to enjoy a walk just outside the heart of the city. The two are very close about 15-minute walking distance apart from each other.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_-xfj-eypLS2pzHeKE6YpAf--OIDuJrL"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dYjgJXIlhUnwMLhQzhOqmFlZAdm6ENKT"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dBfqMLqXwqkEOfqyK9qyK8elhEf6DwFr"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LXh0U6tXHPw6zfEaQngeCZiiPVtLLZrp"><p>At the end of my city tour day, I was able to went to a voting booth for a sneak-peek of how Bolivian vote. Although guarded by armed policemen, I was able to enter the hall and everything was just normal at that moment.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=186CF_2jDmYCFM0_WrT4zbFUcDXs2SJ4u"><p>This concludes my peaceful stay at Sucre. Life quickly turned to chaos the next Monday due to the protests against electoral fraud.</p><p><strong>Sucre Tips:</strong></p><p>There are some museums and churches to visit in Sucre. Unfortunately, everything was completely closed due to the protests during my 2-week stay in Sucre so I did not visit any of them… For those who is interested, you can check this <a href="https://www.bolivianlife.com/your-travel-guide-to-sucre/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> out. </p><h1 id="My-Student-Life-in-Sucre"><a href="#My-Student-Life-in-Sucre" class="headerlink" title="My Student Life in Sucre"></a>My Student Life in Sucre</h1><p>Back to my primary reason visiting Sucre, I wanted to learn some Spanish! Aside from the scenic city view, Sucre is one of the hot spot for learning Spanish. My hostel also provides Spanish lessons, but for a real student feeling, I enrolled at Sucre Spanish School. For its location, facility and overall feeling of the school. There I signed up for 6-hour one-on-one Spanish lesson per day for two weeks! The cost was 40 BS (approx. 5.8 USD) per hour, not bad right? To enhance my experience, I also signed up for a local family home-stay. The cost was 100 BS (approx. 14.5 USD) per day including breakfast and lunch.</p><h2 id="The-‘Ideal’-Student-Life"><a href="#The-‘Ideal’-Student-Life" class="headerlink" title="The ‘Ideal’ Student Life"></a>The ‘Ideal’ Student Life</h2><p>With everything all set, I was very excited to re-start my student life with school time 8:00 - 12:30pm and 2:00pm-4:00pm every weekday!</p><p>The school environment was very nice and it provides free coffee and tea!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AlI2r7LsLba3ZBCHKSFRmLoVIgav2mJ6"><p>My teacher Karem was a very outgoing person and part-time journalist. For the two-week’s study, we also had outings to the local market (based on my request to learn food in Spanish so important for me so that I could understand the menu!) and local cafe to introduce me the best Bolivian coffee. She had quite a taste of food and drinks! We had tried fresh juice, Bolivian cherizo burger and several other items at the market. Although the load of study was quite heavy, I did not think of that 6-hour of daily school time was a little bit too much. Everyday, I need to get up early in the morning to catch the lesson and for the night, I need to study another 2-hours for the homework…I was a little bit exhausted almost every night, but I enjoyed a lot for my time at this Spanish school.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10xykZbad07qzFHXxRgOb9NvdRI0xRqav"><p>For my second week, the school hosted a party for all student at lunch break. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KEsu_vj8hhCXKMG7mXEIfGA3DPRGcw3O"><p>Besides the school, I also signed up for a home-stay with the local family. The host family was HUGE! So the Bolivian culture is the children live with the mother even after their marriage. So in my host family, we have the grandma, two families of the daughters and two families with the sons in a huge house. I got one individual room with shared bathroom together with two other British girls at early twenties. We also had a very beautiful garden. Everyday, grandma would prepare us breakfast and lunch. The house was only 15-minute walking distance from the school. I had a very comfy queen-sized bed with a desk to study at night. The family only speaks little English but my intention was to experience Bolivian culture and practice my Spanish so everything seemed to be perfect.</p><h2 id="The-REALITY"><a href="#The-REALITY" class="headerlink" title="The REALITY"></a>The REALITY</h2><p>Starting from my second day of school, the entire country went into chaos due to the presidential electoral fraud. My peaceful morning walk across Plaza 25 de Mayo turned out to be struggling to get through the angry demonstrators…For a long time, many streets were blocked by the residents using almost everything one could thought of, desks, trash bins, ropes etc…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hyIAXfEvKvVU8bK_FvBJIiSAnbd40iCW"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1h3C5DIWVEG_UO7ls3d4sMYhiHqpinAwb"><p>As time went by, the situation escalated. People started to burn buildings, block roads. And more and more people joined the protests. Evo Morales the president at that time, even sent military out. For a week or so, all highway were blocked. Nobody was allowed to travel anywhere! The entire country seemed to come to a halt. Most of the shops, restaurants, markets were closed for a couple of days in Sucre. Luckily, compared to other major cities like La Paz, Santa Cruz, Potosi etc., the Sucre demonstrators were mostly peaceful. But still protests were there day and night almost everyday! And I was trapped in Sucre for a while due to the fact no bus companies were able to provide services at that time.</p><p>Study had to continue but sometimes our lesson would be disrupted by the marching:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IFmZD8w9UvElgzz6Abv9vVSW1ZzMYQnm"><p>And at night as well.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1CR7TEw4YHUPhm0U37_XxkJ95ZLEVDXWy"><p>But nothing stopped me from finishing my assignments! This was me, a determined student in this chaos time. After several days of study, I was able to read the news paper at least for the headline!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tkXnpo5ceg7Rv-rcFx6-7iJTTlLS4LGw"><p>It seemed to be a little bit crazy and dangerous. My life in general was not disrupted too much. I still went to school and had a room to study and sleep everyday. Yes, I was trapped in Sucre and most shops were closed making it difficult to hunt for food. But friends, most Bolivians only eat two meals a day, breakfast and lunch. So I proved that human beings do not actually need so much food!  </p><p>Another unpleasant instance was that I moved out of my host family after a week of stay. Long story in short, I did not get along with the two British girls. This was my only time that I did not get along with other travelers for my backpacking trip. Our first meet was awful and it got worsen everyday. Although the host family was very nice, I decided not to pretending my friendship with the girls anymore and moved back to Spanish Friends hostel at the end.</p><h2 id="Spanish-School-in-Sucre"><a href="#Spanish-School-in-Sucre" class="headerlink" title="Spanish School in Sucre"></a>Spanish School in Sucre</h2><p>For those who may be interested, here are some options for Spanish schools Sucre with good online reviews. </p><ul><li><a href="https://sucrespanishschool.com/lesson-prices.php" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sucre Spanish School</a>, my pick for its location, studying environment, facilities and free coffee and tea!</li><li><a href="https://spanish-friends-school.webself.net/spanishfriends" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spanish Friends</a>, it is actually a hostel and my home in Sucre. Owner Gavi is very friendly and with perfect location. The reason I didn’t enroll there was that I was looking for a more school-like environment, not a classroom at a hostel…</li><li><a href="https://www.megustaspanish.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Me Gusta Spanish</a>, with good online review. But it is a little bit further away from the center and compared to Sucre Spanish School, the facility was a little bit out-dated.</li></ul><h1 id="Maragua-Crater"><a href="#Maragua-Crater" class="headerlink" title="Maragua Crater"></a>Maragua Crater</h1><p>Maragua Crater hike is probably not on the bucket list of your South American trip. To be honest, I did not know this trail until I arrive Sucre. Although the it has little reputation, this is an exceptional hike. There is not much of information on this trail but with some research and courage, you can still have a self-guide 2-day hike! Warning, yes, for some parts it is difficult to find the trail and one may get lost. I was struggled to find my way wondering in one of the village along the way for about an hour or so. But we made it! </p><div class="note danger">            <h4 id="Before-You-Start-Off"><a href="#Before-You-Start-Off" class="headerlink" title="Before You Start Off:"></a>Before You Start Off:</h4><p>Download <a href="https://maps.me/#gsc.tab=0" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps.Me</a> and get <strong>offline map</strong> ready!</p><p>Download <a href="https://maps.me/#gsc.tab=0" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps.Me</a> and get <strong>offline map</strong> ready!</p><p>Download <a href="https://maps.me/#gsc.tab=0" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps.Me</a> and get <strong>offline map</strong> ready!</p>          </div><h2 id="My-Best-Friend-Paula-in-Sucre"><a href="#My-Best-Friend-Paula-in-Sucre" class="headerlink" title="My Best Friend Paula in Sucre"></a>My Best Friend Paula in Sucre</h2><p>I said ‘we made it’. So let me introduce my best friend Paula. We met at Spanish Friends hostel sharing the female dorm room for almost a week. She was a college student came to Bolivia for her college project. Sucre was her first stop and she planned to get some Spanish lessons while looking for volunteer opportunities in this country. </p><p>She is probably the most environmentally concerned people I ever met. Not like other people saying that I am a vegetarian and care for the planet balabalabala all by their mouths. She is the one do it by actions! I mean it. Of course she is a pure vegetarian not a surprise. In her bag, she carries a container, a set of dining utensils, a stainless steel mug, water bottle and a life-straw. For what reasons? So that she does not need to use paper/plastic plates and cups for most of the time at local food stands and the container was for leftovers. With life straw, she refills her water bottle and never buys bottled water. And collected my plastic bottle for extra water storage during the hike. She also washes plastic bags for re-use. I considered myself care for the planet but compared to her, I felt ashamed sometimes. I wasted food if it was not tasty and while trying my best to minimize the usage of paper/plastic plates, I do not want to bring containers and cups with me while traveling…</p><p>Anyway, we spent quite a lot of time together having meals, studying, reading, chatting etc. So for the weekend, we decided to go to Maragua Crater together. Our first and last Friday night hang-out before the hike! By the way, Paula is German who drinks beer as water! How I love Germen, punctual and beer-lovers, cheers! Thank god, we found a bar which was open during the protests with some efforts though . See I told you, life was not too bad in Sucre.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1VsgHIFXcIkOyVpGoItmSJVikjaXGGLQW"><h2 id="2-Day-Self-Guided-Hike"><a href="#2-Day-Self-Guided-Hike" class="headerlink" title="2-Day Self-Guided Hike"></a>2-Day Self-Guided Hike</h2><h3 id="Day-1-Sucre-to-Maragua-Crater"><a href="#Day-1-Sucre-to-Maragua-Crater" class="headerlink" title="Day-1 Sucre to Maragua Crater"></a>Day-1 Sucre to Maragua Crater</h3><p><strong>Sucre to Trail Head</strong></p><p>We first took a taxi to catch a bus going towards the little town of Potolo. It was not a bus terminal, but many mini vans, buses spread in two parking lot. Given the fact that both of us only speak little Spanish, it took us some time to find the right bus. There is only one budget bus at <strong>9:30am</strong> going to Potolo daily! If you miss it, then taxi is your only option. But the price will be much higher, like around 100 BS compared to the bus ticket 13 BS.</p><p><strong>Inca Trail to Maragua Village</strong></p><p>After 2-hour’s driving on a windy gravel road, we were dropped at the “<strong>Virgen de Chataquilla</strong>” statue. We spent quite a while in search for the trail head, which is very difficult to locate. The trail begins with a long descent towards the town of <strong>Chaunaca</strong>. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1q7Z-_0ZH4hRbrMwK4fpkT4ziyEpV_n47"><p>After about 1.5-hour descent, we reached the low spot of the day where the ticket stand is located, requiring a 10 BS pass for accessing the areas beyond. This is where it gets tricky as both written and map information is limited. There is a dirt road on the west side of the river, Rio Cachimayu, which directly accesses Maragua, and another dirt road on the east side of the river which requires a connection on a separate unmarked trail. The main western dirt road climbs gradually while the eastern option is flat along the river until the end when it requires a steep climb to the crater. We continued on the dirt road path. The beauty of the trek unfolded as we gradually climb up along the path. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LbEAxk-Ay4iWdv0mZP8nBYi12CGfq2sT"><p>In the afternoon, it started to rain a little bit. There we met the double rainbow, and the angel cloud!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZBSxikJMtgzPQ-AGFawRQUdRQI8or35o"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16IND9Xxfwac68SBnPGq91s87IFjqo2xj"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Wqj0W7K_dklU3akZmCjqWdA-PBrYyZog"><p>We also passed by several small villages along our way and had a lovely herd of sheep as our accompany.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GVIsSJUN6VzDpr73Lqv2A7-em5VRqSPh"><p>After about 7 hours hiking, finally we made it to the village of Maragua Crater and paid our last 10 BS pass of the day. In the village, there are several spots you can check out, like a waterfall (very very very tiny one) and a shop which only sells water not even coke! So basically, there is nothing in the village. But we found our lodge for the night to sleep “<strong>Don Basillo</strong>” (also called <em>Rumi Wasi</em>) which is located on the main road, right across from the school.  Again, very basic and do not expect to take a shower there. But dinner and breakfast included. Of course, there is no restaurant. We were very lucky for being the only two guests at the hostel. The owner very friendly and tried to serve us well. But the dinner was terrible…Only potato, rice and an egg. I was not complaining and understood that was the standard for this remote village. But I could not finish my plate but the egg. Sorry Paolo. I wasted my food and Paolo took my leftover again. </p><div class="note info">            <h4 id="Pass-Toll"><a href="#Pass-Toll" class="headerlink" title="Pass/Toll"></a>Pass/Toll</h4><p>10 BS (~1.45 USD) is required for taking this trek. According to some blogs, there is only ONE pass required for the entire trek. However, the truth was that you may randomly meet locals at major view points or entry of the villages and request you to pay the passes. Some of the travelers were complaining this as robbing money. To be fair, it is a very small amount of the money and probably used for support of community. I was not annoyed at all. And for our day one, we paid 40 BS in total each.</p>          </div><h3 id="Day-2-Maragua-Crater-to-Potolo"><a href="#Day-2-Maragua-Crater-to-Potolo" class="headerlink" title="Day 2 - Maragua Crater to Potolo"></a>Day 2 - Maragua Crater to Potolo</h3><p>After our breakfast with bread and tea at our hostel, we left the village at 8 a.m. and continued on to Potolo where we would hop on a bus back to Sucre. The scene of the Maragua Crater is splendid!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lw9Af3B_WrsudcHvvHTUz3pngL79Mt72"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1i66Rb8NhX4J52IfBIltCtR_1XU8Vva6s"><p>But the trail was a little bit demanding with lots of ascending and descending on gravel road.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Nm7intVoKqKgXn6LAwnRsYncWg5wBRgg"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KN_03M63PffTFN6IhvCaypCjiQ_wk0sb"><p>Our first spot on the second day was the dinosaur foot prints. Again this spot was hidden somewhere around a village and no MARKINGS at all along the trek. We almost got lost. Thanks to <a href="https://maps.me/#gsc.tab=0" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maps.Me</a> I was able to locate the spot after 45-minute’s wondering in the bushes and rocks! There I saw a couple with their guide. The lady was complaining that ‘Oh, this 5-minute’s walk was really long. It’s almost half an hour!’ and the guide replied with a smile, ‘That’s Bolivian’s time.’ ‘We are German, and when we say 5 minutes, we mean 5 minutes!’, the lady said like very seriously! I would say maybe German should group with Chinese or Japanese :) Italian, Spanish and French may survive better here. Just my personal experience, no offense here to my friends world-wide. By the way, here we paid 10 BS again for the pass. Anyway, here comes the dinosaur foot prints. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1R69JZkuGLo4njVazVoRgS2ZqMoeSEbEq"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qTmoh_AkN6lusM5NV3obZoLaLxUSI4CT"><p>After this spot, we continued climbing uphill and walking downhill by passed several villages and had our lunch with a herd of dogs. My leftover was shared with these dogs.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15tMZQd1FT1yKbTP6250JfaKtg58-af1u"><p>And finally, we arrived our destination at 4 p.m. This time, we were able to find a store next to the main plaza of Potolo! I had a coke and Paolo had a beer to celebrate our completion of the 2-day hiking! We waited about an hour for our mini van back to Sucre. The 2-hour ride on a narrow, windy, gravel road up to the side of the mountain was not comfortable not to mention the bus was so crowded! But at this point of my trip, I was used to this type of bumpy, crowded, and noisy ride. I am tougher now!</p><h2 id="More-Information"><a href="#More-Information" class="headerlink" title="More Information"></a>More Information</h2><h2 id="Hiking-Distance-and-Time"><a href="#Hiking-Distance-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Hiking Distance and Time"></a>Hiking Distance and Time</h2><p><strong>Day 1</strong></p><p>Hiking Distance: 17.75 KM</p><p>Hiking Time: approximately 6 hours without break time included</p><p>Highest Point: 3663 m</p><p>Notes: first 2 hours mostly descending with some small ascending but mostly flat on gravel road.

There was no regular buses running between major cities. Many travelers were trapped in Sucre. Students at school were exchanging information regarding the bus services every day during the break. After about 2-week’s uncertainty, finally we got good news that most buses companies would provide their service this weekend! So I decided to leave as well and November 1st was my last day (half day) at school. I got my bus ticket to Uyuni the next day!</p><p>That Friday happened to be one of the biggest holiday in Bolivia, day of the dead (Todos Santos). So I decided to spent my afternoon to the general cemetery in Sucre. Yes, a cemetery and actually is a popular tourist attraction in Sucre. Gavi even suggested me and Paolo go there to study as she told us ‘it is very beautiful and quiet.’ Of course, we did not study there. But the visit there on the Todos Santos day was very special! So first, Bolivians had a very special way to bury their dead. While it has its share of mausoleums and headstones, the majority of the graves are narrow slots in the wall. Arranged into barracks – often 7 plots high – the gravesites look kind of like very tiny, high-efficiency apartments. Lots and lots of them.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Au0TMK5QOwe26-K-cLcPcQ3VfZrKLYjF"><p>During the Day of the Dead in Bolivia, people believe that the souls of the dead come back as spirits to visit their homes for twenty-four hours, from noon on November 1st until noon on November 2nd. It is the one day of the year where the souls of the dead return to Earth. The traditions of the holiday are all centered around those twenty-four hours.</p><p>People prepare their family’s tombs in the local cemetery. The maintenance of cemeteries in Bolivia is generally done by families throughout the year, rather than by cemetery staff. For Day of the Dead, families clean the graves, place fresh flowers, and brings traditional cookies and bakeries.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10xm13QgELmm04n0phe6iiek7KT3bnvd5"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_NjZbhbE77x-A2FkeLR8orad20Qkxeki"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1sfudysup9z1fG0FEwPVFEibL3l0VPPJu"><p>By the way, the families also gives their offerings to friends and visitors. Yes, I was the one who do not reject food, and the cookies were very tasty!</p><p>This afternoon concludes my 2-week stay at Sucre!</p><h1 id="Food-in-Sucre"><a href="#Food-in-Sucre" class="headerlink" title="Food in Sucre"></a>Food in Sucre</h1><p>As I said, I do not like Bolivian food. The worst among all was their quality of rice, which was very dry and tastes like plastic. Also partially for the reason that most of the restaurants were not open during my stay at Sucre. So mainly I lived on street food, food stand in their central market, and meals prepared by my host family. But the cost of food is really cheap, on average 20-30 BS per meal.</p><p>First, some meals from my host family which I do not know the exact name.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FLQPCe4v6n9lwjSLaxAb87PoOKnKMotF"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1eY-f-B2ah_2hODgjyfrgIa1hpbYh1lbS"><p>Then, several famous dishes from Sucre.</p><p>Soupa de Mani (Bolivian peanut and potato soup), however I did not taste any peanut…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1TONiotxd2zvxNIM5yCBRiCjYkm58lgbZ"><p>Mondongo, a typical dish of Sucre, made with crispy fried pork with a bit of the skin — accompanied by corn, potatoes and a a rich red aji chili sauce.</p><p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1N3SkkfPoqkF9KjMmGeEtRZgrIHCI3I8g">Then the grilled chicken dish.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YrZwMamba5ErUQDnbHFPe3vnxFEpfv7F"><p>Thai food in Sucre.

Taste was OK but rice quality was above the average Bolivian standard!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Y1JwuBNfKaM4vO7weNnNO46PwCigCgq0"><p>Then the street food. I actually tried lots of street food in Sucre but unfortunately I do not have photos for all of them. During my South American trip, I met several backpackers complained about the food hygiene issues in Bolivia. Half of them got food poisoning in Bolivia. Really, I meant it. But maybe I was lucky or I need to thank my strong Chinese stomach, I had no issue eating street food in Bolivia. But I also need to break my own limit. Since most street stand if not all, do not provide you with utensils to eat. Which means you need to eat with your own hand after hiking in the mountain or wandering around the city. No places to wash your hand. Also the food was prepared by bare hands, the owners collect money, take raw food, then cook the food with their hands. Compared to those hands, I thought my hands were clean enough without washing to eat my food :(</p><p>Grilled beef heart with potato:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1sBBREQtFoFPSw6_p3PtfCWvywD3jS9IC"><p>Grilled pork burger:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12zLL7L-AerzF7YdZivzJKKHE_3zDN_dg"><p>My favorite grilled fish in the fish market again:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lf9Pj2LqWQ4_oV3uWoYyyGihI0gGgfgq"><p>Other street food without pictures which were good:</p><ul><li>Chorizo burger</li><li>Api: made from purple maize, cinnamon, water and sugar, the beverage is colorful, heavy and delicious</li><li>Bolivian pizza</li><li>Assorted grilled meat (I did not know exactly what I had…)</li></ul><h1 id="Log"><a href="#Log" class="headerlink" title="Log"></a>Log</h1><p>Sucre stay from October 19 to November 2, 2019.</p><p>Next stop: Uyuni, Bolivia (Overnight bus to Uyuni, Bolivia at 20:00, Nov. 2, 2019)</p><p><em>This post was published at Phoenix on June 17, 2020.</em></p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;Sucre is the white city of Bolivia and it is one of the best city to have some Spanish lessons not only for its budget friendly tuitions but also for the layback life-style in Sucre. However, I arrived at the wrong time. Several days after my arrival, Bolivia experienced the biggest protests in decades and basically turned the country to chaos…What an experience!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After 55 days in Peru, I am moving on to my second country in South America - Bolivia and reaching the highest capital in the world, La Paz, a city full of CABLE CARS!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1s6KosZzvYMBpZzKwnZlp7jHMYnicrrO8"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Bolivia-Initialization-The-Painful-Document-Preparation-for-Visa-Application"><a href="#Bolivia-Initialization-The-Painful-Document-Preparation-for-Visa-Application" class="headerlink" title="Bolivia Initialization - The Painful Document Preparation for Visa Application"></a>Bolivia Initialization - The Painful Document Preparation for Visa Application</h1><p>Well, my friends, while U.S. passport gives you the freedom entering most of the South American countries, Bolivia is probably the only one asking for entering visa!</p><div class="note info">            <p>GOOD NEWS!!!</p><p>As of December 20, 2019, U.S. citizens <strong>no longer need a visa</strong> to enter <strong>Bolivia</strong> for tourism.</p>          </div><p>OK, poor me, at the time I visited Bolivia, US citizens were required to have tourist visa. Not only I spent a whole day at my hostel in Cusco painfully prepared all the required documents for visa application, but at that time the application fee was 160 USD?!</p><p>Anyway, I guess I do not need to share too much information on how to prepare the documents for visa application now. Just a short list of what I prepared:</p><ul><li>Yellow Fever Vaccinate Certificate (It was required by the government, but NO ONE asked for it at the border of entry)</li><li>Bank Statement</li><li>Bolivia Itinerary</li><li>First Night Hotel Reservation</li><li>Bolivia Exit Bus/Flight Ticket</li><li>Two Colored Passport Size Photo</li><li>1-2 Colored Copy of Your Passport</li></ul><p>FYI, you can get every ready in Cusco and just bring the documents and get on a bus/flight to Bolivia!</p><h1 id="My-Long-Way-to-La-Paz"><a href="#My-Long-Way-to-La-Paz" class="headerlink" title="My Long Way to La Paz"></a>My Long Way to La Paz</h1><p>Again, based on my Google research on the craziness of crossing Bolivian border as a backpacker, I chose <a href="https://www.boliviahop.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bolivia Hop Bus</a> to get to La Paz. The main reason I chose Bolivia Hop was it says that the company offers visa application assistance and will drop you off at your hostel in La Paz if your hostel locates in its serving area. This route starts from Cusco and stops at Puno, Copacabana and then arrives at La Paz. During the route, you can choose to get of and stay at Puno and Copacabana for couple of days and hop on the bus to continue the trip. In Peru, its counterpart is called <a href="https://www.peruhop.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peru Hop</a>. This is a very popular way of traveling Peru. You just buy a ticket and you can get on and off at any of its route’s stop for couple of days until the final destination. The disadvantage of the hops are first the prices are 1-2 times higher than the normal long distance buses and secondly you do have cama buses (the bus with beds) no matter how long is the route! </p><p>Enough introduction for the hop buses, here was my opinion. Probably you do not need hop services! First, the visa assistance was like nothing! The guide just walked us crossing the Peruvian border. Second, I checked my Selina in La Paz which is within its service area and the agent guaranteed me that the bus would drop me off at Selina. It turned out that the on-board guide rejected the small detour and I had to took a taxi at 11p.m. with all my luggage after 24+ hours ride!!! So friends, just pay less and get a regular bus or pay the same or a little cheaper but find a cama bus to La Paz. Lastly, the bus ticket costed me 195 soles (59 USD) excluding breakfast &amp; tours.</p><h2 id="Lake-Titicaca"><a href="#Lake-Titicaca" class="headerlink" title="Lake Titicaca"></a>Lake Titicaca</h2><p>Lake Titicaca is a large, deep, freshwater lake in the Andes on the border of Bolivia and Peru, often called the “highest navigable lake” in the world. It is also a very popular tourist spot and one can visit it either from Puno, the Peruvian side or at Copacabana the Bolivian side. While the lake is very beautiful, I personally do not recommend you spend extra time going there. It was not worth your time and money at all. Keep on reading my experience below.</p><h3 id="Puno"><a href="#Puno" class="headerlink" title="Puno"></a>Puno</h3><p>The bus arrived Puno at around 6 a.m. after 8 hours’ overnight ride. There you will have an option to have breakfast for 9 soles. This bus stopped at Puno for 3 hours and then continued to our next stop. So I signed up for a 2-hour Lake Titicaca tour. <strong>NOT WORTH IT!</strong> It was the most unpleasant tour in South America. Too commercialized sites and pushing locals selling hand-crafts. </p><p>Puno at dawn.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_97rUhotcoKQaj0PpyG8P-cOsQStoqTJ"><p>If anyone has Puno on his/her itinerary, it must for the famous floating islands on Lake Titicaca. The Uros, live on islands made of living reeds that float around the lake. The Uros people have been living on the lake for hundreds of years—they were forced to take up residence on the floating islands when the Incas expanded onto their land. This concludes my Puno tour highlights. </p><p>While the lake itself and the scene are amazing, you know it the HIGHLAND LAKE, I was very disappointed about the tour. The tour started with 45min motor boat trip to one of the floating island. Each island lives a Uro household, which means it is really tiny! There is almost nothing go see and remember the entire tour was 2-hour…</p><p>So the floating islands:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HnAnuBaaWJu8-YjkGjxZY5jMVSgMwypP"><p>The Uros greeted us by singing a song. Once we landed on the island, we were given a 10-minute mini introductory presentation on how Uros build and live on these islands. That’s it! We are given another 10-15min free time on the island but it was mainly for them to sell us hand-crafts. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Zmqsg3o0tLMKik-WRzs_1RLVWawLRJLx"><p>Before we depart, the locals invited us to ride their reed boat and said that our motor boat would pick us up at the mid-way. So our group gladly boarded the boat. Then one local came to the boat started collecting money. The ride costs 10 soles! No one told us before! The way they asked for money was kind of rude and a couple got really angry and got off the boat. I understand that the local people need to make a living on tourists but the feeling was really unpleasant. As Puno being my last stop in Peru, I actually spent all my soles. So I had to pay them U.S. dollars. They just grab $5 from my hand and NO changes back :(</p><p>The Uros’ Mercedes-Benz, the reed boat.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-N2YLesFQ1L0VnJKHHGznQ2QGfMPWU-X"><p><strong>Puno Tips:</strong></p><ul><li>The 2-hour tour booked with Bolivia Hop was 35 soles. </li><li>If you are an independent traveler, probably you can find better deals at Puno harbor. There are plenty of options. You can also opt for an over-night stay on the island.</li><li>Lastly, this <a href="https://www.peruforless.com/blog/uros-islands/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> contains useful information and may help you to plan your trip at Puno.</li></ul><h3 id="Copacabana"><a href="#Copacabana" class="headerlink" title="Copacabana"></a>Copacabana</h3><p>Some people say that it is better to visit Lake Titicaca from the Bolivian side, the town called Copacabana. Our bus stopped at Copacabana for 4.5 hours and again you can book a 4-hour boat trip to Isla Del Sol, a real island on Lake Titicaca. Since I was very disappointed at Puno, I did not go for the tour. </p><p>So for the 4-hour stay, I did a small hike to <strong>Cerro Calvario</strong> which is right next to the harbor for a panoramic view of the town.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_dY9e7ljBZ4xO37Bz3l6I7u9cMIjLt65"><p>The hike was moderate and took about 1.5 hour. For the rest of the time, I just enjoyed my time at a bar viewing the lake and tasted <strong>llama meat</strong> for lunch! Peaceful time and money well spent!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1D-TNcIkI6SJXA2f0KEZRCfnuAR6cD3g8"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1__-rLpdUWiZAIkK1CZQ0F39UR43kcCOt"><p><strong>Copacabana Tips:</strong></p><ul><li>Many people stay at Copacabana for a day or two or even more. It is a very relaxing tiny town but I guess there are not too much to do.</li><li>For Lake Titicaca, there are two real islands (Isla Del Sol and Isla Del Luna) you can visit and even stay a night on one of the islands. I heard that if you stay over-night on the island, you would see very beautiful sunset and enjoy the lake with fewer tourists.</li><li>Also there are several hiking trails around the town. </li></ul><h1 id="La-Paz-The-Highest-Capital-of-the-World"><a href="#La-Paz-The-Highest-Capital-of-the-World" class="headerlink" title="La Paz - The Highest Capital of the World"></a>La Paz - The Highest Capital of the World</h1><p>Finally, after 24+ hours, I arrived Selina La Paz at around 11 p.m.. Yes, wherever there is a Selina, I call it home! And always, first night welcome drink provided as a Selina member. Cheers La Paz!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18W63UlwY6qqw1eSqpNZfdfZubN8tqhSq"><p>Before we start on my La Paz tour, let me give you several fun facts of the city:</p><ul><li>At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. </li><li>Given the fact that its geography location, one need to climb up and down while walking in the city. Really, it is like hiking in the mountains but in an urban setting. Sometimes the slope of the streets can go up to 45 degrees or more!</li><li>Based on fact two, guess what, instead of light rails or subways, the cable cars are the common public transport mode! The cable car system consists of 10 different lines covering various of the city areas! </li><li>La Paz is not the constitutional capital but only an administrative capital. So to many Bolivians, the historic city <strong>Sucre is the REAL capital</strong>, not La Paz. </li></ul><h2 id="La-Paz-City-Tour"><a href="#La-Paz-City-Tour" class="headerlink" title="La Paz City Tour"></a>La Paz City Tour</h2><p>Um, there is not much to tour around in La Paz. Downtown La Paz was just so-so and really the city is not walking friendly given the streets winding ups and downs.</p><p>Look at this, the uphill street, and everyday I need to hike to places and restaurants. Really, a difficult place to gain weight since after your meal you would burn everything to get back to the hostel…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QmumzuXDfmPxU0mjNS-CF6tjiC79ZneC"><p>The government palace and its guards in service.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SEd7HxGiBdn5BMPeWyIvvsyqRokfzf_p"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hS5nee5nlaBPOP6uZyNiEAQYsTtKQbA9"><p>Church of San Francisco:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18J-nZ3JoPZgdbOyDkzYD5CprKOx9BN_a"><h2 id="Witches-Market"><a href="#Witches-Market" class="headerlink" title="Witches Market"></a>Witches Market</h2><p>Witches Market is a popular spot for souvenir shopping and general sightseeing of the city. The market located in the touristic center of La Paz, just one block from San Francisco church. You may save your alpaca sweaters and souvenir shopping in this market. People told me that prices are cheaper than in Peru. I cannot verify this since I did not buy anything in Peru nor in Bolivia. I was a little bit hesitant to ask for prices since I knew I would not buy anything.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DCjaTnuRMy8s6UQphYGeqsNx09XxttOS"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1uEi2dHLvwOkD8EHgJFS866LnqFy5FMXm"><h2 id="Cable-Car-Tours"><a href="#Cable-Car-Tours" class="headerlink" title="Cable Car Tours"></a>Cable Car Tours</h2><p>I have to say the cable car system is WONDERFUL and very modernized! One-way ride only costs only 3 bolivianos (~0.45 USD). I highly recommend everyone to try it out! It is a great way to go around and view the city.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1B1ZA5Yd4hnicuFqmGTpD2myQs9riwp-P"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RElSom3H2K1qFGSgbqlpZkvf6k4SDy9v"><p>As I arrived on a higher district of the city for a panoramic view, there I saw the president campaign. Yes, I arrived Bolivia during the their president election. At that moment, everything was peaceful then to chaos. You never know what would happen next. Compare to what we are experiencing worldwide and in the U.S. as of June 2020, the Bolivian chaos was just a tiny wave of the turbulence in my life. OK, let’s just put a mark here and we would talk more about Evo later in my Sucre story.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Y3uQN8c98LYCqeBbro82su9FSTdMMeNs"><h2 id="Valley-de-la-Luna"><a href="#Valley-de-la-Luna" class="headerlink" title="Valley de la Luna"></a>Valley de la Luna</h2><p>Valley de la Luna is a park and was recommended by the hostel reception. Although it is located a little bit outside the main tourist area, one can still get there by public buses. Do expect a long ride though, about 1.5 hour one-way from city center. The park itself was just OK and not very big. You can tour the entire site in 2-3 hours at most. Also, if you plan to continue to Chile, you can probably save your time. There is another Valley de la Luna which is much more epic compared to this park in San Pedro de Atacama in Chile.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1VW30ps6FMfrhrAkzXWaOvlQmvxWEhRAC"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pY7rKDEvl9s-Uemd0XcQNFeYb5cskNNT"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ItTjN5Y8zDjvrJu3emDTAS_BleWQC7GW"><h1 id="Asian-Food-in-La-Paz"><a href="#Asian-Food-in-La-Paz" class="headerlink" title="Asian Food in La Paz"></a>Asian Food in La Paz</h1><p>I confess that I did NOT even have on Bolivian meal in La Paz…I randomly found one Chinese restaurant near my hostel and from then on I fell in love with it. This is the best Chinese/Asian restaurants I tried in South America! Friends, save your Bolivian food quest later and you would probably be disappointed. Yes, not much ‘tasty food’ in Bolivia compared to Peru. </p><p>Check it out the menu has Chinese on it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After 45 days in Peru, finally here comes the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aKB0eMTlpC7HrXxsh-CsF5AH-9CKPYV4"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Cusco"><a href="#Cusco" class="headerlink" title="Cusco"></a>Cusco</h1><p>After another comfy sleep on bus cama (a bus with 180 degree reclineable seats) by <a href="https://www.civa.com.pe/servicios/excluciva" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Civa</a>, I arrived Cusco at around 6 a.m. I directly took a taxi to Selina Saphi. Yeah, there are two Selina locations in Cusco, where else I would stay? There is only one thing I want to complain about Selina is that they have a relatively restrictive check-in (after 2pm) and check-out (before 11am) time. On my first arrival day, I could not get in my room but to leave my backpacks and come back later in the day. While I was researching what to do in the lobby, there arrived another group of backpackers. One girl approached me saying that she saw me in Arequipa and we chatted and quickly decided to do the city walking tour together.</p><p>Let me spend several words on this international group. There was me, a Spanish girl (Alba), an Italian girl (Matilde) and an American-Chinese boy (David). The three backpackers were all job quitters and met on their way to Cusco. Here I joined the club. With a Spanish speaker in our group, we decided to go to the market for an authentic (and very cheap) breakfast! It was my first group tour in South America and turned out to be an adventure of mixed feelings. We hit market ONE and toured around the huge food-court, while I did not see any differences in meal options, the group decided to go for a better market for breakfast. OK, then we continued our search for breakfast. After almost 1 hour, we finally settled down in a crowd of local people having warm lamb soup with rice! Task 1 completed. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tNzd-_2pD7axJ0ku10QHMu6uFu5JwZoc"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wJm7ByM4Es9OAaOYY3pEeecfGdXejt98"><h2 id="Cusco-City-Walking-Tour"><a href="#Cusco-City-Walking-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Cusco City Walking Tour"></a>Cusco City Walking Tour</h2><p>Then we started the walking tour at 10:30 am. There we separated, Alba and Matilde went for Spanish tour while me and David joined the English-speaking tour.</p><p>Cusco was once the capital of the Inca Empire, a city full of culture, history and fun. However, being the most visited city in Peru and probably in the entire South America, the city is very commercialized and touristic. Do not take a photo of anything from the fresh guinea pig at local market, to cute baby alpacas on the street, unless you are willing to pay for tips. Even if you want to enter churches at Plaza de Armas, you need to pay for entrance fee?!</p><p>A city walking tour is highly recommended since there you will learn some interesting facts and history about Inca Empire and the city. The tour started no surprise at Plaza de Armas.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xScxhT65m7QNKJ-s2dqOz4Tfr46a-woW"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11o4kY4gLUYip-Kl4tbkQpLCgInuKGq-b"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1A4LU29QiBJckD65JZibABpK9jbRrT-V7"><p>We continued our walk through small alleys with perfectly lined up stone walls built by Incas on the left and ‘ugly’ uneven Spanish built walls on the right.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fP1k2DwMdbndVpeSbjev5tz2VbB2Otx3"><p>Then one of the archeological site where we learnt human sacrifices in Inca culture. Yes, of course, unavoidably, there were human dead bodies actually only human skeleton. I don’t want to say too much about the selection, preparation and process. But both boys and girls were selected and according to my guide, they were drugged before the moment came…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1r94ukAPMt4Hd9rGlDubV5UpwixbL3_V4"><p>Then we went to the artistical neighborhood and ended our tour at a bar with a panorama view of Cusco.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1oK6zW_je4eHIbWMi5vIs8zJWSc-Ym6VH"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OMarRaw98Rk8WT1cL0-X_8vZz-fvmV5N"><p>Oh, one thing interesting I learnt from the tour is that you can look for arrows in the street like the one in the picture. This is the only one with four arrows which was located in the center of the Inca Empire (somewhere near Plaza de Armas) with arrows pointing major Inca regions in four directions.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IHhYRGzjlxAVvH7MZdVBF_g_DNVq4Ffd"><h2 id="White-Christ-and-Pukamuqu"><a href="#White-Christ-and-Pukamuqu" class="headerlink" title="White Christ and Pukamuqu"></a>White Christ and Pukamuqu</h2><p>On the second day, I decided to check out one of few FREE sites in Cusco, the White Christ. It is located on Pukamuqu mountain at a height of 3,600 meters and you can get there either by taxi or hike up for about 45 minute. Once you get there, you can also tour around another few free archeological sites and the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacsayhuam%C3%A1n" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sacsayhuamán</a>.</p><p>So I got myself ready to go at around 7 am in the morning. There I was caught by Alba and their group had no plans for the day…so she said they would love to join me to Pukamuqu. This day turned out to be EXTREMELY long.</p><p>Our group departed Selina at 7:45 am and decided to go grab breakfast before the day tour. Matilde wanted western breakfast and Alba wanted cheap local ones. After group vote, we were on the way to market. Again, difficult choices at market to decide which food stand to eat…there were no agreement made so we went separately for breakfast. Then we waited for the each person to finish and finally everybody was ready to go. All of a sudden, the girls decided to shop around the market for local souvenirs? OK, anyway, it was a little past 9 am and still early for the day. So we did toured around and ended up buying nothing. While I thought finally we could go up the mountain, David forgot bringing his cell phone. Matilde said she would also love to go back hostel to use the restroom…So Alba and I had to wait them in the Plaza de Armas…After they left for 15-minute, it started raining. Alba and I had to find some stores to hide for the rain. We had to contact the hostel re-visit group for new meeting location. After another 30 minute waiting time, finally we re-grouped. It was still raining heavily so we decided to go to Starbucks the only cheap store for a coffee nearby. The line was huge since most of people came due to the rain. While waiting in line for coffee, the tragedy happened again! This time was Matilde who forgot her phone in the restroom?! There came her second re-visit back to hostel…Then she came back and the rain stopped. We should be able to go at this moment, right? NO, NO, NO. Being an Italian, Matilde couldn’t start her day without a coffee. So we waited again. At 12:30pm, after almost 5 hours since my day started, I was still in Starbucks which was only 1.5 km away from my hostel?!?!  </p><p>But that day, with my strong determination, we made it to the White Christ as one group…Does it worth a visit? Probably, no unless you have nothing to do in Cusco. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LxvAXAA4IdG6T1g75AVpzXrVAYn1Uzjp"><p>Cost of taxi from Plaza de Armas: 9 soles one-way. Don’t be fooled by the driver taking you to other expensive archeological sites for a day-tour! It almost mad when Alba and Matilde were about to follow our driver’s recommendation. I had to say several solid NOs to them…</p><p>One tip, if you are interested in visiting museums, churches and archeological sites in Cusco, consider to buy a <a href="https://www.theonlyperuguide.com/cusco-tourist-ticket/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cusco tourist ticket</a> which will save you money.</p><p>At the end of our second group day, Alba invited me to go other sites with them for the rest of the stay in Cusco. I politely rejected their invitation and said I prefer to travel alone…I really could NOT join the Spanish and Italian group with improvise decisions. I know I was on vacation but I still need some plans and some control of my day!</p><h2 id="Tour-Agencies-at-Cusco"><a href="#Tour-Agencies-at-Cusco" class="headerlink" title="Tour Agencies at Cusco"></a>Tour Agencies at Cusco</h2><p>Except for the Inca Trail hike to Machu Picchu (which requires one book 6-12 months in advance), you can book everything directly at Cusco and most of the tours are often available for the next day tour. Booking your tour at Cusco instead of booking online in advance will save you a ton of money! </p><p>So after shopping around, I booked three tours at one agency and below is the cost:</p><ul><li>1-Day Sacred Valley, Moray, and Salt Mine: 90 soles, including guided tour, bus transport, and lunch probably breakfast as well which I do not remember. Extra cost: 70 soles for general tour tickets for Sacred Valley, Moray, and whatever sites included in the tour and 10 soles for the salt mine. I do not suggest this tour, since we visited many different sites in a day and rushing through everything. I was just lazy to go to each and every site on my own. But if you go there with families/friends, you may consider an independent tour for all different sites.</li><li>1-Day Rainbow Mountain and Red Valley: 90 soles, including bus transit, one breakfast, one lunch. Extra cost including 10 soles entrance fee for rainbow mountain and 10 soles entrance fee for red valley. Normal price for rainbow mountain was 70 soles and I paid 20 soles extra for red valley. Most agencies would tell you red valley is optional and they do not charge for extra if you want to visit red valley. However, my agency told me that if I pay extra I would be able to have 1 hour more time staying at the red valley. That was NOT TRUE! I was not given the extra time and I was able to complete both sites with the standard rainbow mountain tour group… Tips: red valley is a must add-on and you do not need to pay extra for the tour just 10 soles extra for the entrance ticket that’s all you need! But the hike maybe challenging, which I thought it was really OK. </li><li>2-Day Machu Picchu Bus Tour: 90 USD including ~50 USD for Machu Picchu entrance ticket, round bus transport, one night private room stay at Aguas Calientes. Tips: Machu Picchu opens at 6 am. I suggest you to get the earliest ticket to avoid the crowd of course you will get the crowd anyway. But for the first 30 minutes, you would find some freedom. As of 2019, Machu Picchu put a restriction on allowed number of visitors into the park per hour. It may not be possible to get the 6 am ticket for the date you want. However, if you will stay at Cusco for 3-5 days, you should be able to get the ticket within your time-window. Otherwise, you can purchase your ticket online in advance. You can buy the ticket on the official website <a href="https://www.machupicchu.gob.pe/inicio" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> and there is some extra information on types of tickets and guides on how to purchase your ticket online <a href="https://www.ticketmachupicchu.com/types-ticket-machu-picchu/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. I wanted to visit Machu Picchu first, however the ticket was not available for the date I wanted. So I had the Sacred Valley tour first, then went to the rainbow mountain and Machu Picchu as my final tour.</li></ul><h1 id="Sacred-Valley-Moray-and-Salt-Mine"><a href="#Sacred-Valley-Moray-and-Salt-Mine" class="headerlink" title="Sacred Valley, Moray, and Salt Mine"></a>Sacred Valley, Moray, and Salt Mine</h1><p>This tour was the most comfortable and easy tour among all three tours I booked. The guide picked me up at the hostel at around 6:15 am. Then the bus took around 15 people visiting various sites. There were almost no hiking involved! You are just required to walk around tourist sites. However, still the day ended at 8 pm back to my hostel.</p><p>My personal favorite is the salt mine although the parts one can enter and visit was very limited and we only stayed at the salt mine for about 30 minutes. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1t4vaxvv7Yq1Ir_dsoGpzNOSkSJ9noNfX"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1s4vRuactd6OEesZ_RMSAJsVgx0IKX1Bo"><p>Moray is also wroth a visit in my opinion. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MGeBmvUYNfhee7wpf7IBEIKYvfPQoKlQ"><p>Then we quickly ‘skimmed’ several other sites during the rest of the day since we were out of time. But we also ‘wasted’ lots of time (about 1+ hour in total) by stopping at 2 souvenir stores. The first stop with local textile dying and weaving process demonstration ended up with selling the rugs and cloths. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1E9tI-DD_isjmfi0iqWy7PeFXOY6vut6Q"><p>On our way back, there was another stop at jewelry store again with demonstration how silver jewelries were made. OK, it was a very touristic day. Again, if you have the time, energy and some companies, you may want to visit Inca sites around Cusco on your own. </p><h1 id="Rainbow-Mountain-and-Red-Valley"><a href="#Rainbow-Mountain-and-Red-Valley" class="headerlink" title="Rainbow Mountain and Red Valley"></a>Rainbow Mountain and Red Valley</h1><p>If you google rainbow mountain, you may find people say the hike is challenging. However, I gained my confidence back when hiking to rainbow mountain. Yes, the trail started at 4600 meters in altitude and you need to climb up to 5100 meters in altitude. But it was not that difficult. However, the day for rainbow mountain will be LONG. The pickup started at 5:30 am in the morning and the round trip hiking to/back is about 3.5 hours and for about 8 km in total. That was including the red valley. By the time I got back to Cusco, it was almost 8 pm…</p><p>At the rainbow mountain trail, you have the option to hire horses but you still need to hike on your own for the final steep climb for about 30 minute. For my tour, there were about 50 people (yes, the agency lied to me saying that if I pay extra for red valley I would be able to join the special small group tour) and only 5 of us visited red valley and returned to the bus with everybody else at the same meeting time! But anyway, I was able to be in the fast group all the time and gained my confidence hiking with normal people not the pros who were always ahead of me for at least half an hour. So here is the rainbow mountain, the colorful peak is actually very tiny…but the views at the trail was amazing!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18kiWt8EHk_XzKIgowkq1XLT26-Evuhjd"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1v4xrtGIESvm4YO9JLvB-ev1w0twY1lQS"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=178CRXfOCzS3KPn8UovnsYCn5j1bgkKpL"><p>If you want to visit red valley, you just take another trail back instead of hiking on the same trail to rainbow mountain. The red valley trail will involve a little bit uphill hiking instead of all downhill back to the parking lot and probably 1.5 km longer. But it is totally worth it. </p><p>The red valley trail is one the right and on the left is the rainbow mountain trail. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1reYUPn3aPGoRNIZIB8P4ejszzoajXZFj"><p>And the small uphill red valley trail for a better idea. Keep in mind, most visitors said they were exhausted after climbing to the tiny peak of rainbow mountain. So you need to make your own decision. Anyway, you don’t pay extra for the tour so that you can decide after you visited the rainbow mountain. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RKGK_fj8A-C7h77rcnBDdvok-Gg99xUK"><p>And finally, the stunning red valley at 5049 meters in altitude. It is much better if you see it in your own eyes!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1N1uVm7LttJDCAMNyWjAgiTVPIoS1mXKM"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SCEHCP50p7b5ZWofvKKIDTbCWq20njBU"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NuDZbvqPy6FN-QAm87WySopQcLx_3YqP"><h1 id="Machu-Picchu"><a href="#Machu-Picchu" class="headerlink" title="Machu Picchu"></a>Machu Picchu</h1><p>I believe that I do not need to put introduction here for Machu Picchu. But you may want to know how to get to Machu Picchu. So there are three popular routes leading to the world famous Machu Picchu! No matter what route you take, your destination is a village at the mountain of Machu Picchu, named Aguas Calientes.</p><p>The most expensive but most comfortable way is to take a train either from Ollantaytambo or Cusco. Of course, from Cusco is more expensive. But you can complete your Machu Picchu tour in a day or two. Expect to pay 300+ USD in total for round-trip train tickets, Machu Picchu entrance ticket (~50 USD as of 2019), and round-trip bus tickets to/from Aguas Calientes (12 USD for one-way bus ticket as of 2019).</p><p>Hiking to Machu Picchu! Dear friends, this means multi-day hiking and they are not easy ones!</p><ul><li><p>The Inca Trail (4-5 days): this is the most famous hiking trail to Machu Picchu. You need to reserve your spot at least 6 months in advance and cost about 600 - 1500 USD depends on your luck…</p></li><li><p>Salkantay Trail (4-5 days): this one you can easily book your tour at Cusco and it is relatively cheap option, expect to pay around 200-250 USD for this tour. However, this trail is VERY challenging and you will stay in tents all nights before you reach Aguas Calientes! Initially I was determined to take Salkantay trail to Machu Picchu but my self-confidence was completely destroyed at Colca Canyon…</p></li><li><p>The Jungle Tour Trail (4 days): this tour will combine serval outdoor activities like mountain biking, white-water rafting and hiking together. You will be able to stay in hostels. Cost is around 250 USD. I was not interested in this option at all for the beginning.</p></li><li><p>The Bus + Hiking route (2 days). This is what I took for its low cost and OK level of hiking (walking) requirement. You will take a 7-hour bus then hike for around 12 KM to Aguas Calientes for day 1 and day 2 you will visit Machu Picchu and walked 12 KM back followed by another 7-hour bus trip. Cost is around 100 USD.</p></li></ul><p>My Machu Picchu tour day one started at 7 am for taking the 7-hour bus to Hidroeléctrica. Then after lunch (around 3:00 pm), you need to hiking/walk along the train track for 12 kilometers to Aguas Calientes…The good news is that 95% of the trail is flat. So I reached my hostel at Aguas Calientes at around 7:00 pm. Guess what I met the Alba and Metilde while wandering around the alleys in the village looking for dinner place. So we had dinner together. You may think the next day to Machu Picchu should be an easy task. NO! There is another 1.5 hour hiking uphill to Machu Picchu! When I visit Machu Picchu, the site had 500 people limitation to enter it per hour. The site opens at 6 am and your entrance ticket has an entre time printed on it. My suggestion is to get the earliest ticket so to avoid crowd. My tour agency purchased the ticket for me. The 6 am ticket is kind of popular that you may not get it for any date you want. However, I guess you may stay in Cusco visiting other sites. As long as you have 3-5 days in Cusco, you should be able to get the earliest ticket within the time-window. Anyway, Alba and Metidel’s tickets were at 7 am the next day so we could not go there together. For my case, since it was really early and I did not want to get up at 3 am and spend 1.5 hour hiking uphill so I got the one-way bus ticket for 12 USD, which Alba and Metidel teased of me not being the real backpackers…</p><p>The earliest bus to Machu Picchu was at 5:30 am and the tour agency suggested me to arrive at the bus station at 5 am. Being naïve, I arrived at the bus station at 4:45am and thought nobody would go early right? I was wrong again. When I arrived, there were about 100 people waiting in the line already!!! People were really serious about being the first to enter Machu Picchu. I went to the head of the queue and asked them when they arrived. The answer was 3:30 am?! I was a little worried about not being able to get the earliest bus. Friends, tips here. Yes, the earliest bus is at 5:30 am. But it is not ONE bus, there were several buses leaving altogether! I was able to board the 4th bus and there were more coming. So really, you don’t need to come too early. 5:00 to 5:15 am will be fine! This is the bus station queue at 5 am in the morning, unbelievably long…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=138DPHz7ZsQGs7N19z1TAwbqwdAHmNBPG"><p>I arrived the gate of Machu Picchu at 5:50 am. It was raining heavily! And again, there was another queue waiting at the entrance gate. Finally, at 6:00 am, the entrance was open and I was able to visit Machu Picchu in the rain without any protections…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aKB0eMTlpC7HrXxsh-CsF5AH-9CKPYV4"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13_Zjt4NwyRywBIu63VVQPWLjE8T91Tv7"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-yCakoBBjxXaas-OmTkp8To305fmBIBm"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yRJ0YbEFRTlyjbQHMqupFJUYwVSl0ddR"><p>I walked around in Machu Picchu for about 4.5 hours without any tour guide…Another tip, if book your tour at the agency, normally it include 1-2 hour guided tour inside Machu Picchu. However, most guided tour started at 7 am. Make sure that the agency arrange the guided tour according to your entrance time. You would think that everything should be arranged by the agency right? NO, again, please check everything before you pay for anything. </p><p>Day 2 was not ended yet. As a budget backpacker, for the return I walked back to Aguas Calientes downhill for 1+ hour and directly moved on to the train track trail back to Hidroeléctrica. The pickup time for the return bus to Cusco was at 2 pm! How busy the day was! Yes, another 12 KM walk! By the time I arrived Cusco, it was almost 10 pm… Some people say the train trail has amazing views. In my eyes, it was just OK, if you go by train you are not missing anything. So if you don’t want to have the real hike (the Inca trail or the Salkentay trail) and you have the budget, taking a train is the best option!</p><p>The following pictures were taken at the train trail, nothing special right?</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IreCP7BIqdJ50H5QPd6gQkQ159zgfNx4"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1kDQIiTQ3BovkagZKnoVJNJQ6JafamFg_"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ev3x96JSmKFCba15hGDrQp5CSzb-f8qf"><h1 id="Food-in-Cusco"><a href="#Food-in-Cusco" class="headerlink" title="Food in Cusco"></a>Food in Cusco</h1><p>I was really busy hiking and touring in Cusco. For the tour days, the average time for getting up was 5:30 am and return time was 8 pm. For the city tour days and resting days, I had most of my meals in the local market. Actually, I found my beloved food stands at the local market for lamb soups which I visited 3-4 times and the roasted pork for 2 times. </p><p>Just to give you an idea for the food court at the local market I always went. Very authentic right?</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Exv1nXT5TP4NJifbZ694qg2qskuo3z3A"><p>My favorite ‘horrific lamb soup’ stand may considered to be not edible to most of my friends. Yes, 10% of the ingredients were above my limits even (for that being said is the eyes and lips of the lamb…). The menu includes lamb head, ear, eyes, knees etc. and no matter what you order you will always get lamb brain, stomach, intestines, rice, potato, dried potato and yucca. The soup is 10 soles and if you are a frequent customer and as cute as I am, you can ask for extra soup, brains etc…yes, the brains are so delicious and see my Spanish was enough for most of the things I’d like to eat (seso for brain, arroz for rice, and sopa for soup plus no papa y yucca the potato and yucca)! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QYPExDU5wDDBF9qOTHjq0HSRXDBJ_5Ec"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1K36guDcKY-Eexc71vOnmj_a1smduVkL3"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11UG_AnCEkrFdYS9SIdDLtf-WOwDf84nZ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1W_fB78m9wFS0YEYWuZeWjoTCPF4L9Nd3"><p>My second favorite breakfast item, the roasted pork. Yes, meat for breakfast and heavenly tasted! Huge portion for 15 soles. No utensil provided and use your hands to eat. Thank god, I survived Amazon and using hands only was not a challenge here.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ERkeQYub9XcsQ6DrtRZqW71qQT44m3Sy"><p>Beef tongue stew at local market for only 18 soles as one of the dinner.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Suy16XdLwUdFWSnfJRN6nxYJW6zb8W8K"><p>For late night dinner after the tour, I was always exhausted and had no interest at all going out searching for restaurants. So I believe I had the Peruvian hamburgers from the street food stand next to my hostel for 4-5 times…It was surprisingly good!!! Costs only 5 soles. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QbpZHhYQEBQz_tm-QjComhRlv26hnO0e"><h1 id="Log"><a href="#Log" class="headerlink" title="Log"></a>Log</h1><p>Cusco stay from October 4 to October 13, 2019.</p><p>Next stop: La Paz, Bolivia (Overnight bus to La Paz, Bolivia at 22:00, Oct. 13, 2019)</p><p><em>This post was published at Phoenix on February 14, 2020.</em></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Arequipa, known as the white city and the most beautiful city in Peru. It was true! One of my favorite cities in my South America trip, not only for its beautiful city but also for its surrounding nature. I highly recommend you put it on your travel itinerary! If you ever visit Arequipa, you have to check out <strong>Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve</strong>!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nIf_NQu-qS5OOSBJcGK2_9lUWkl_H7H8"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="Arequipa-Journey-Restarted"><a href="#Arequipa-Journey-Restarted" class="headerlink" title="Arequipa - Journey Restarted"></a>Arequipa - Journey Restarted</h1><p>Arequipa was not on my original travel itinerary. It came cross to my mind during my ‘real-time’ travel planning in Lima. Based on Google, it was claimed to be the most beautiful city in Peru. Whenever I saw superlative adjectives for a place, I have to check it out. So after resting in normal life in Lima for almost a week, I decided to continue my real journey in South America. Yes, no more computer work, grocery shopping, hanging out with friends and convenient city life! I need to TRAVEL!</p><p>If you never heard of Arequipa before, it is the second largest city in Peru and surrounded by three handsome volcanos. One can easily find good restaurants, bars and cafes to chill, visit various museums in the city or choose to go for outdoor adventures like multiple hiking in Colca canyon, day tours in the national parks, white river rafting etc. Trust me, just come to Arequipa, it has almost  everything you want (just not that famous like Machu Picchu).</p><p>Let’s start with what you can do in the city.</p><h2 id="Plaza-de-Armas"><a href="#Plaza-de-Armas" class="headerlink" title="Plaza de Armas"></a>Plaza de Armas</h2><p>Undoublably the most beautiful plaza in Peru or you can say in South America. I was stunned when I saw it!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QJ8W7fGJx5E6H12Y8W4U-J0Z6hYPce9l"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZtcrNt5GW1qpRlKR5uWC6kj6ZN1AeLlc"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_uRC87mBTRPBmMgtblQB-6VZ4G5SMP_U"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Cu5_sbla-dOuwlWiZ7taz1SnpkpjFEC2"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-527ejZkX0iueb4mZHSUs64xKpH8mMEK"><h2 id="Free-City-Walking-Tour"><a href="#Free-City-Walking-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Free City Walking Tour"></a>Free City Walking Tour</h2><p>In most of the South America large cities, you will find free city walking tour. It says FREE but actually the walking tour is tip-based. I found it good for travelers to get to know the history, culture of the city in a nutshell. With the tour guide, we started from Plaza de Armas, then visited hidden pretty neighborhoods, the traditional San Camilo Market, stopped at several churches and museums for general information. </p><p>Sample stops of my walking tour.</p><p>A historical tiny neighborhood. There we also learnt the Christian-Inca green cross with combinations of symbols from two religions.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cv6rHXa0y67DigKTi2eBtOkkFgsafLwL"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1z321o059J4wR6XWryMBBtalvVAfObvqc"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1E_4rX72ndYJiDXJdZE_6At7fQ8ymucCN"><p><strong>San Camilo Market</strong></p><p>Like most of the Peruvian cities, there is a local market close to the Plaza de Armas. San Camilo Market is the most authentic market you will find in Arequipa. You will find food courts, butchers, local spices, fruit stalls. </p><p>Remember the renowned French engineer Gustave Eiffel? The buildings and roofs were designed by him. Not sure why there are so many his works in Peru. Yes, you will find his design in Cusco as well.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1O1tLBT4ZIi_Q747iu_iYw92V9FNBobe2"><p>Peru is the country for POTATOS. Guess how many kinds of potato can be found in Peru? Over <strong>3,200</strong>?! You may need to spend your lifetime to try them all! To be honest, I cannot tell too much differences among them…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-7aTBBLDbhbpj2AxRgBoa7ogVyVmw71p"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZZtbv9SlopcE-hHfbFb6tzc7J_jdBc9N"><p>Another interesting thing you can find in the market is the witch’s stands, where you can find Inca medicines from herbs and animals…The witches are also known to help you to keep your love relationships magically. You are welcomed to consult your problems there. For me, it is a pass :) </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1k4-eh3KxXJ6ESh2qWpHLJnAkHluPzbs6"><p><strong>Queso Helado (Cheese Ice cream)</strong></p><p>Suggested by our tour guide, the best queso helado place in Arequipa. It is DELICIOSO!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1e75Ez8t272YVniDGVWInkX5TRtnJmQ3J"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jHE8vn4OvASRh6Ecufy_yJRT6T1ZlGPw"><h2 id="Santa-Catalina-Monastery"><a href="#Santa-Catalina-Monastery" class="headerlink" title="Santa Catalina Monastery"></a>Santa Catalina Monastery</h2><p><em>Santa Catalina is one of the most impressive colonial religious buildings in Peru. The large convent is a ‘city within a city,’ covering over 20,246 square meters (218,000 square feet) and preserving the characteristics of 16th and 18th centuries, with narrow twisting streets, tidy plazas, colorful courtyards, and simple living quarters with Spanish names like Córdova, Sevilla, and Toledo. The delicate pastel colors of the buildings contrast with bright flowers, period furnishings, and religious art making it the <strong>picture-perfect</strong> place to explore some of the history of Arequipa.</em></p><p>But Santa Catalina is actually a nunnery guarded by imposing high walls. The nuns entered the monastery would live their whole life and even buried inside. For religious reasons I understand this but to me it sounds like a prison. Put my personal feelings aside, the monastery shows a masterpiece of colonial architectural design and many people claim that you can get best portrait photography there.</p><p><strong>Ticket Price: 12.5 USD/ 40 soles (yes, a little bit pricy)</strong></p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iZ-MTI7ZC3RhMqB8qlzuPitadIkzyJE9"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZTOPbRwiNegDonBZZRG7H9uXWgtzIyu6"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=17Bh2rDpJGQMkpC7rm-FNkAENzhf3rlHL"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KBacFBgYJHRcTAj6zs7IFe0r1WRDCslO"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1JD2Hz6KRfcD9H9-BU8gIhK2iO7bZcHRZ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bQiJ1bDX4M5rmrF5wlujn3rODI9L9Xd4"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1F45d7A6Mwjyc6rIMDmvoayUQ7e9hA1eG"><p><strong>Mandu Alpaca</strong></p><p>Located very close to Arequipa historical center,  Mandu Alpaca has a very small zoo, a gallery and a museum that you can learn the tradition, process and history of alpaca textile industry. </p><p>For those who have not seen alpacas and llamas, there is your chance to feed and pet them for FREE!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lpfsJxswsE-KgShuFJeNfFX4sOd822pq"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FmNAjAexnCVZKeIssW1ZxR0bBQn17L9_"><p>There is a museum that tells you the differences in animal fibers. The finest fiber is from Vicuna followed by alpaca. The expensive cashmere turns out to be the third.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZmXH3yfglH6pOuNIsxM0RZdDDX4McObi"><p>Also, there you can find traditional hand-made rugs.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Hvql5p6o82A2E12arueRdLgW-FM2Mzee"><h2 id="Selina-Arequipa"><a href="#Selina-Arequipa" class="headerlink" title="Selina Arequipa"></a>Selina Arequipa</h2><p>Selina again! Why this hostel can be listed as one of my tourist spot in Arequipa? It is the most beautiful Selina among all I stayed and I rested there for two days without touring at all in Arequipa. Yes, one day after my two-day hiking tour in Colca Canyon. I can chill out all day long in its garden or by the pool side.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1glnV2vFbLOUst7JiPXlB29sffYLq5IX_"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fw0TjQDIrlMBhuT9FCvnDCEfgoZ37Gyd"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11puibDN9_mg2ZRdQQNnjDwonNeExRFWc"><h2 id="Other-Places-inside-Arequipa-City"><a href="#Other-Places-inside-Arequipa-City" class="headerlink" title="Other Places inside Arequipa City"></a>Other Places inside Arequipa City</h2><ul><li>Yanahuara District - for its panorama view of the city and the white buildings, colonial-era churches and leafy plazas. Not that special compared to the central district in my opinion.</li><li>Museo Santuarios Andinos - for the best-preserved of all the Inca mummies - a ice-preserved girl sacrifice named Junita. While being one of the most popular museums in Arequipa, I did not go there. No courage and interest to see dead human bodies…</li></ul><h1 id="Colca-Canyon"><a href="#Colca-Canyon" class="headerlink" title="Colca Canyon"></a>Colca Canyon</h1><p>Colca canyon is listed as a must-go place if you are in Arequipa and the second most visited place in Peru (first being the Machu Picchu). It is also known as the second deepest canyon in the world and best place to spot the Andean Condor! Information collected, how come I would miss this spot on my South American adventure? I need to conquer it, right? So I signed up on a two-day hiking tour.</p><p>Friends, especially friends from the Grand Canyon State, no need to conquer it through hiking… a touristic one-day bus ride is probably enough if you really want to go. Or you can make your decision based on my hiking experience.</p><p>My tour agency told me it would be an easy hike with all food and lodge (not a tent) organized.  All I need was a daypack for water, some exchange cloth and swimming suit for the pool in the lodge and the outdoor hot spring for the second day. Trekking difficulty was anything from EASY! It almost destroyed my confidence in outdoor activities…</p><p>The two-day hiking tour started at hostel pickup at 3 a.m. After 3.5 bus ride, we arrived for breakfast at Chivay town around 7 a.m.</p><p>Before embarking on our trek, we made a stop at Cruz Del Condor to observe the world’s largest flying birds with over 3 meter wing span in action. That was stunning!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HL-UcXCYmZ4_8sJqlltJfcSlRkSkOnqD"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16-XLoO0JM6SIvFek-tWG-TNQ6Jewvsxe"><p>Then the minivan left our group at the trailhead with a nearby volcano in action. Yes, the white thing far way was not cloud but the smoke from an erupting  volcano.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-cFB-UXLgGmG7GgKaLZHM6-o15RlOXiF"><p>We soon started our first leg of trekking at approximately 3300 meters in altitude. It was a three-hour decent of 1200 meters on loose gravel with soaring temperature under direct sun!</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1UUaXLY01NFwzUgtdv5MEGRxo5iyv6oPg"><p>The first two hours went OK. But gradually, I was not able to keep up with the group. Fine, I admit I was the oldest in our group (they asked you to put your ID and age on a sheet before the trekking) but I thought really I was grouped with professional mountain climbers! Also I was in my new pair of hiking shoes which was killing me. Just in two hours, I had five blisters on my feet and one blood-fed toe nail… My guide was not helping but kept pushing me to speed up saying that we are behind the schedule. Which was not that true. Before we started, we were told time-stamps of the breakpoints. We arrived lunch place on-time! Remember, I was in a group of ‘professionals’. This made me felt like a slow-paced mid-school student who constantly being called in front of your classmates by your teacher while you were trying your best to keep up with your peers.</p><p>Anyway, we had our bird-sized lunch at lunch stop, probably 5 thumb-nail sized llama meet with little veggies and rice. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19X-yqiB51eYcjMXSEZXVHRaQw2ht77hs"><p>Soon after lunch, we continued our way to the village for the night going up and down the canyon, crossing villages and rivers. The oasis with swimming pools were our destination for day-one, which was lovely. After   another 3-hours hiking we arrived Oasis de Sangalle.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iCY-6n1bHA-83tts9SU1TRPLKynIXtt_"><p>So day one was completed after 13 km hiking total descending of 1500 meters before sunset at around 6pm. The lodge was basic but the swimming pools were nice. However, I was too exhausted to try the pool.  Dinner was provided at 8:30pm even worse than lunch, only kid-size pasta with tomato sauce and flakes of cheese. That was the only protein I had for dinner after almost seven hours hiking! </p><p>After the dinner, we were told about the schedule for the second day:</p><p>4:30 am - start trekking</p><p>8:00 am - reach the top</p><p>8:30 am - breakfast</p><p>9:30 am - bus pickup</p><p>Again, the guide emphasized the importance of sticking to the time since bus would not wait for us…I only had a nap on that night, since we finished our dinner really late at around 9:30pm. With the most two active group members assigned to my room, I was not able to sleep until 11:30pm. No matter what happened, we gathered as a group in the cold and dark morning of the second day at 4:30 am. Our guide again ‘kindly’ asked me to consider taking a mule up. I nodded and started the last leg of the trek. This part is the most challenging since the trail has only one direction that is up, up and up (elevation gain of about 1500 meters) in 3.5 hours. Without any doubt, I was soon left behind which was OK and I prefer to ‘climb’ in my own pace without my guide pushing me all the time. But actually, I was not alone. There were people along the trail hiking in normal to slow speeds. But soon I met a group of guides at one of the breakpoints. ‘Lan, you are too slow. You should take the mule up and I already checked they only had two mules left! We are not going to wait you at the top!’ my guide shouted. This made me pissed off and got really angry! I was on the move all the time with only water break and there lots of people from other groups behind me. I would like to shout back to him, but I was out of my breath. So I fought back, ‘I am here to conquer the trail not for a mule ride. If I would be late, you do not need to wait for me and I would find my way back on my own’.  I don’t want to be rude, but being polite sometimes does not work. I left the guides behind and slowly climbed up. Magically since then, my guide changed his attitude and kept moving with the ‘turtles group’ as all other guides did! Finally, I made it to the top at 8:05 am on foot!</p><p>After 10 minutes rest, our group continued walking to the village for breakfast. Yes, another 20-minute walk to breakfast place?! At least this time was on the flat surface. The guide told the group, we would have fried eggs for breakfast, so let’s go! I do not know what made eggs so special like caviar in South America, but eggs are my favorite protein source even now I am back in the U.S. You can try to have veggies only for several days, and then have a boiled egg. The taste will make you feel in heaven!</p><p>After the breakfast, finally the highlight of the 2-day Colca canyon trekking tour, the outdoor hot spring! Remember we are in the volcano area? Another erupting volcano near the spa. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jJMe5kHXFFMI7Hlj4oCCjXzRrthEEi2j"><p>The only downside about the hot spring is that it only have very basic facilities and pools are not that clean. With this beautiful surroundings and springs from the volcano, Peruvian people maybe you can borrow some ideas from the Japanese?</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KhB6AKqHG0IHybr4I082yIfGnTnyzh1f"><h2 id="Colca-Canyon-Summary"><a href="#Colca-Canyon-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Colca Canyon Summary"></a>Colca Canyon Summary</h2><p>Based on the information from Google, Colca Canyon ranks the second deepest canyon in the world. But our guide told us it is actually the forth deepest. The first and second are in China and the third is Grand Canyon. I am Chinese and lived in the Grand Canyon State for over 3 years. I’d say, trekking in Colca Canyon is not worth the pain. The geographic landscapes are not as stunning as Grand Canyon! I maybe biased, for me, Arizona and Utah are way better than it! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FZp7B23FKUkQM3AqBTVISCPR_pJZEwjT"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MziUwqHCQ4wQRMEu4PYBfwTrgLtNFfs-"><p>The cost of the 2-day Colca Canyon trekking tour:</p><ul><li>Guided tour: 90  soles</li><li>Colca Canyon National Park entrance ticket: 70 soles</li><li>2-day lunch (not included in the tour): 30 soles</li><li>Hot Spring (not included in the tour): 15 soles</li></ul><h1 id="Salinas-y-Aguada-Blanca-National-Reserve"><a href="#Salinas-y-Aguada-Blanca-National-Reserve" class="headerlink" title="Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve"></a>Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve</h1><p>I was a little bit disappointed after the Colca Canyon tour until my visit to Salinas National Reserve. It was a huge WOW to me! Its landscapes are unique and stunning! Also this place was recently open to public in 2019 and there are few people. For the day I went, there were only two groups, eight people in total in the park. You own the park! The national park is home to many wild animals like vicunas, pumas, flamingos, wild birds etc. Also not one, not two but tons of llamas and alpacas!</p><p>Words are not enough to describe its beauty. Let’s prove it by pictures. The day I went was cloudy and raining. It would be thousands times better in a sunny day.  </p><p>The landscapes:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1L0mptosGjg4eX6N137Fw60KKMUOQIqGQ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-SyV7YKb0sYYHlm9nj4bIvN2i5OZ9sdH"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Nrw5PENpxol6li66dQ0BFxHDCCMhD218"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MLmaFEWkYjitAgL0GklvKE1LZHBxBNrF"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1b9L3_k2M0M9fR8805Xo_QezjLBd-PnjC"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=160ODgGIjiqBxBVjSXMD8mO9wK38ca4ON"><p>A group of vicunas relaxing on the ‘salt flat’.

      &lt;p&gt;Arequipa, known as the white city and the most beautiful city in Peru. It was true! One of my favorite cities in my South America trip, not only for its beautiful city but also for its surrounding nature. I highly recommend you put it on your travel itinerary! If you ever visit Arequipa, you have to check out &lt;strong&gt;Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lima take 2! This time it made me feel like coming back home. OK, I have to admit I travel for nature, local people, and native cultures but every time I stopped by a large city, it made me smile! You will soon see my deep love for Santiago and Buenos Aires, and not that deep love for La Paz…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wJ24LMhR-dtAHlkVo_qAUtAGsDA1U0_J"><a id="more"></a><h1 id="The-Pro-Airport-Ground-Transportation"><a href="#The-Pro-Airport-Ground-Transportation" class="headerlink" title="The Pro Airport Ground Transportation"></a>The Pro Airport Ground Transportation</h1><p>My flight from Iquitos was delayed for 1.5hrs and I arrived Lima at 2am in the morning. My first hostel in South America, was 1900 Backpackers in Lima central district. It was very nice and staff were welcoming. But for my second stay I would like to explore the famous trendy Miraflores district in Lima. For your information, there is <a href="https://www.airportexpresslima.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">airport shuttle</a> connects you between the airport and Miraflores district. But it only runs between 7am to 12am. The only choice for me was the taxi to go to downtown. Back in August 20, I connected 1900 Backpackers hostel for a private airport pickup for 20 USD which is the standard cost for hotel pickup. After one month travel in Peru, I think it is way too expensive. So I decided to find a taxi on my own. Please note, Jorge Chavez International airport is located next to main street, it only takes you 5 minutes until you can find local buses or cabs. While some people may tell you it is unsafe to do that, I think it was fine. So I carried 20+kgs of my backpacks and walked to the main street and very soon I was able to find a taxi and negotiated for 20 soles to Miraflores. Did you see the word ‘negotiated’? Yes, I was able to speak some Spanish words and was very proud of myself for this!</p><p>For a side note, the Chinese brand Huawei is so popular in South America, it has advertisement broads in almost all South American airports, airplanes and major cities. I was even ‘blamed’ by a tour guide (in San Pedro de Atacama Chile) for not having Huaiwei cell phone as being a Chinese since she was waiting for the latest Huaiwei model to show us how to take a photo of the moon through a telescope…Sorry, I know Huawei is awesome but I have my love of Nokia…</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IXkanARUOn0R5LYlfMFSeN69LM3AApgh"><p>The same applies for Chinese cigarettes like Zhonghua and Double Happiness, although Chinese cigarettes were not easily found in convenient stores.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Q3ImkfukF3tFSOkBzbZuZXZRPLyDPuyu"><h1 id="My-Private-Tour-Guide-Cynthia"><a href="#My-Private-Tour-Guide-Cynthia" class="headerlink" title="My Private Tour Guide - Cynthia"></a>My Private Tour Guide - Cynthia</h1><p>Before I start to talk about my second tour in Lima, I have to say a big THANK YOU to my local friend Cynthia. Cynthia has a warm heart for helping people out. When I was struggling to figure out the price for a mini van to Gocta waterfall at the bus terminal in Chachapoyas, as an English teacher, Cynthia came to me for help. Yes, she was the one who provided me the non-touristic hiking trail for the exhausting 8-hour adventure in Peruvian Andes. So on the bumpy drive to Gocta, we chatted along the way. It turned out that she lives in Lima and once she knew I would re-visit Lima she gave me her WhatsApp account and asked me to contact her when I came back to Lima. I sent her a message on the second day of my arrival just wanted to ask for a local good shopping mall so that I could buy a new pair of hiking shoes. To my surprise, she kindly said that she would take me tour Lima from a local’s perspective. It was not a one-day tour. She met me on a Sunday and then she took me to different places since that day after her work 3-days in a roll. I think if I would stay in Lima longer, she would even take me to nearby mountain for a weekend-hiking.</p><p>With Cynthia, I was able to take public transport visited various neighborhoods, famous Jockey shopping mall, tried several great local restaurants. Here is my lovely Peruvian friend, Cynthia (she gave me the approval for posting her picture in my blog)!</p> <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16B9J6ZDeuCWVlGxzi0qy3pHfvGb4UGrC"><h2 id="Barranco-and-Chorrillos-Districts"><a href="#Barranco-and-Chorrillos-Districts" class="headerlink" title="Barranco and Chorrillos Districts"></a>Barranco and Chorrillos Districts</h2><p>On our first day of city tour, Cynthia took me to Barranco district known as the SoHo of Lima, Peru. There are plenty of things to do in Barranco; it is full of renowned art galleries, cute boutiques and trendy coffee shops, that were once colonial mansions of Lima’s elite. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nbEBXeQoNOV_PZnvwXErnGgW6imIT8P9"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1T0OwdtQMUtiUWxBrUnwuRghpZ_FfIKCY"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ZFd-9kbrGsdBEM9n0VowyVQGPKsDT1Lu"><p>We were luckily picked interviewed by a research group from University of San Martin de Porres for the traveling experience in Lima. I was on local TV! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1S2ZXUWebrkZ421e5VIZ4ynOrmn24pXer"><p>The Barranco neighborhood also happens to be situated along the costal cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. We walked along the costal boulevard and hit Chorrillos district. There was nothing too much to visit Chorrillos but Cynthia’s school was located there and it was on our way to get the public bus back to Lima downtown.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wJ24LMhR-dtAHlkVo_qAUtAGsDA1U0_J"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1VvLj0GKxGQnEm2ylI6io5xNEOgkX17ew"><h2 id="Magic-Water-Tour-Park-of-the-Reserve"><a href="#Magic-Water-Tour-Park-of-the-Reserve" class="headerlink" title="Magic Water Tour - Park of the Reserve"></a>Magic Water Tour - Park of the Reserve</h2><p>If time allows during your stay in Lima, I highly recommend you to check out Park of the Reserve.  For a price of 4 soles, you can watch the water and light show there. Please check the website for its show time. </p><p>The park actually locates in Lima central district. However, during my first stay, the park was closed for some special event. I was not very interested in the water show, again I was in South America for nature! But Cynthia highly recommended me for a visit. So one day after her work, she took me there. It turned out to be a wonderful experience. While the show is only for half an hour, the park is huge with various fountains lit up at night and one can easily spend 2-3 hours for the visit.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10PaUTeEdd-VyjMbqvXrbrFTTbsSQh75m"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1XAIlThUJAzbUrzeHT7KH_sv0an1PXKmN"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Zm1sae7Bi_-RLOn_eNZOmWUR0MClFXaQ"><h2 id="Jockey-Plaza"><a href="#Jockey-Plaza" class="headerlink" title="Jockey Plaza"></a>Jockey Plaza</h2><p>Jockey Plaza is probably one of the biggest shopping center in Lima. My old Northface hiking shoes were broken in Gocta hiking trail and I was desperately in need for a new pair of hiking shoes for many future hiking trails to be conquered. Cynthia took me shopping around in central Lima district, and Miraflores. Those mini shopping stops all failed due to the two reasons. One was that I need a trustworthy brand and the second and most importantly was that I am OVER the average size for people in South America…the average height for women is 155cm (5’1 feet) and 165cm (5’5 feet) and I am 178cm (5’10)? So our last resort was Jockey Plaza. There is nothing to much to say about Jockey Plaza, it just like most malls in the U.S. But we went there on a weekday after Cynthia’s work. Before we set off, she told me it was really close by. That night, we started by an express bus by waiting in line to purchase the bus ticket for about 15min then got into the station waiting line for another 20min to get on the express bus. Check out the waiting lines on the freeway cross bridge, they were all waiting to get in! The in-vehicle time was only 20 minutes since they have designated bus lanes on the freeway. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1j5el5H221UjQzM_OkHlu5PtM3oJDc6cr"><p>Do you think that’s it? NO, our journey continued with a 20-minute walking transfer leg to catch another crazily crowded local bus. The conductor was hanging out of the bus for most of the time so that the bus could fit more people. So after two hours, we arrived Jockey Plaza. Cynthia told me this was normal for traveling in the peak hour, what a city life!</p><p>Jockey Plaza carries many U.S. and European brands and even the layout and design is very much like shopping centers in the U.S. Unless you need to re-stock your gears, you probably don’t need to go there.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13xTuM7Axe8MNhEpcMVJsQDNF4OSGo_Xr"><p>Luckily there were several good outdoor brands, like Northface, Summon, Merrell and Patagonia etc. The prices were much higher compared to U.S…so I ended up with one of the cheapest choice for Merrell and paid approx.. 120 USD… The most expensive item I bought in South America. My options have to be with Gore-Tex and here I have one recommendation for all of you. Please pay the higher price for Gore-Tex products especially for your hiking shoes. You will not regret! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Edo0obrxfckgYnN1Bs0Q5172BnQh7WYn"><h1 id="Life-in-Miraflores"><a href="#Life-in-Miraflores" class="headerlink" title="Life in Miraflores"></a>Life in Miraflores</h1><p>My second stay in Lima or maybe I should say in Miraflores made me feel like home. The Miraflores district is very very nice for living. I thought I could live there forever. One of the most important reason for this was that I found my beloved hostel chain brand <a href="https://www.selina.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Selina</a>! I highly recommend everyone to try it out. Selina has hostels all over the world and it is rapidly growing. For the moment, its main market is in South America and Central America.</p><h2 id="Mi-Amour-Selina"><a href="#Mi-Amour-Selina" class="headerlink" title="Mi Amour - Selina"></a>Mi Amour - Selina</h2><p>Here let me express my love for a hostel <a href="https://www.selina.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Selina</a>~ Selina Miraflores was the first Selina hostel I stayed and from day 1 I fell in love with Selina. From then on, for every city I passed, as long as there is Selina, I had no hesitation to stay there. So for my 4+ months travel, I believed I stayed in different Selina hostels for approximately 30 days! So what make it so special (observations made based on Selina in Lima, Arequipa, Cusco, La Paz, and Buenos Aires):</p><ul><li>All locations are always in trendy districts and walking distance to almost everything you need</li><li>All facilities are GREAT even with U.S. and European standard.</li><li>All rooms are clean, beds are comfy with curtains, showers are SUPER hot with sometimes too strong water pressure</li><li>Internets are always SUPER SUPER fast</li><li>Always equipped with GREAT common kitchens, nice café and bar</li><li>It offers very good co-work space in almost every Selina locations with an extra fee though. You may not believe, I have used the co-work spaces at four out of six Selina I have stayed. Decorations and space sizes may differ but they were all gorgeously designed. Trust me, you will love to work there.</li></ul><p>The best Selina hostel I stay is the one in Arequipa (I will have another section for Selina Arequipa) and the best co-work space is in Lima!</p><p>Just for a glance, Selina Miraflores café and breakfast: </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10_31oq90SeszK-1qs8wA0UrSrZUWaX8L"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12ANNEp41wHgryYBue2OkUUe6BFOo7GoE"><p>My favorite Selina Co-Work space in Lima. All co-work spaces came with a simple kitchen and this one even has a gym and a indoor spa pool?! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1snFDFtfGJsYaESBd-OIRY17ZK2HZ8RrW"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mENVL1peW17yHLjXDvD3j4-s4EcLPWs6"><h2 id="My-Daily-Routine-in-Miraflores"><a href="#My-Daily-Routine-in-Miraflores" class="headerlink" title="My Daily Routine in Miraflores"></a>My Daily Routine in Miraflores</h2><p>As said, Selina always has a GREAT common kitchen and just across the street there was a supermarket. So For most of the days, I cooked my own meals. My days started at 8 am with fresh juices and breakfast prepared in the common kitchen. Then I headed to the co-work space working on travel plans and my blog (yes, I did not upload lots of posts in real time, but I did try hard to do so). In the late afternoon, either I went for grocery shopping or walked around the parks, churches, stores. For most of the nights, Cynthia would come and we may have some evening tours in Lima. What a wonderful life! </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pmUghdPzziXRYCVeu64GwNCvPOfyoKc_"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fs1flPa0AWrktXVtVALIRlpWLDXM2tWZ"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FwIH9g8DqZvVhgSfIALQ_U9de2JBozSH"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KtSlexJF-Iv88UTjYRunD-Ilo2VrMgh7"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MnuKerK6nlqjrf-w4XbJqeX0ecnnYSZR"><h1 id="The-Food"><a href="#The-Food" class="headerlink" title="The Food"></a>The Food</h1><p>As I said, I cooked most of my own meals in Selina. Friends, Lima is famous for its award-wining and Michelin restaurants. Also, in my opinion, Peru has the best food in general. But remember, I was just a backpacker with limited budget and NO decent outfit for luxury restaurants. If you are interested in high-end restaurants, I believe you can easily find a long list from Google. If budget allows, you may want to try one or two. I heard that the average price per person can go up to 80-100 USD for dinner…</p><p>The one I can really recommend is <a href="http://restaurantecordano.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Restaurante Cordano</a> located near Plaza de Armas. I had the best beef tongue stew (38 soles) there and they also provide a long list of typical Peruvian dishes. </p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jVLIaPmQ0LqNI1B54NsuCfM4lzg7hh9T"><p>Then some failures in trying not that cheap but not expensive Sushi restaurant. Do not go for cheap Sushi places at all in South America unless you want to have an adventure tasting ever known sushi rolls with ingredients in my opinion should never appear in sushi. I failed several times in all contraries I visited. But this Sushi restaurant has a very unique ordering system so that even you don’t know Spanish, there would not be any problem. You don’t even need to talk to your waitress. But look at their deserts menu, lemon pie sushi, chocolate sushi etc! This dinner was 51 soles for all-you-can-eat sushi.</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1zBWhjNyq9iLBMSUxXZO1x_witGvfpF5I"><p>Then the tourist restaurant failure. Restaurant suggested by Cynthia was closed so we just went to some random restaurant nearby and turned out to be not that good. But the dishes we ordered were typical Peruvian food. I believe if you find the right restaurants, those two dishes should be very delicious.</p><p>Verde Arroz con Pollo (green rice with chicken) - 30 soles</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wyPTjwH9gaWOGjLQM5KQOaZ-Jy_R7pnh"><p>Jalea de Mariscos (Peruvian fried seafood) - 30 soles</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-va8ZUDKmns0-2JHgW2pk4ASkEqNcI1t"><p>Now time to show off my cooking technique!</p><p>Typical continental breakfast at Selina:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DGpmyvtDZObm2WoyZKN0MydLEtWshUME"><p>Korean style breakfast with rice soup and fried egg:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ov0vd-JsnCy97YDdc-hBQp3y4n413-XN"><p>Dinner cooked for Cynthia - French Moules Marinieres</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18ebGmNQRE110yMQa7UT2Dti-hbls9Vgn"><p>And Chinese pork and veggie stir-fry dinner for one:</p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Qa8vrIqRf47GVJZmKIz3z8MP3cP5xQD_"><h1 id="Log"><a href="#Log" class="headerlink" title="Log"></a>Log</h1><p>Lima second stay from September 21 to September 26, 2019.</p><p>Next stop: Arequipa (Flight to Arequipa at 12:50, Sep. 26, 2019)</p><p><em>This post was published at Phoenix on January 28, 2020.</em></p>]]></content>
