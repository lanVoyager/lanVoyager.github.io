The packing list for my South America voyager. The preparation and shopping started back in May 2019 and part of the gears were purchased from China. Although the backpacks seem to be small from the picutures, the total weight of the two backpacks are 25kg! I am packing way too much backup stuff, which I believe account for about 8kg waste or not so critical stuff. Anyway, reviews of the gears will be updated as the voyager continues.

Maiden Voyager Day 1 (08-20-2019) @Fort Lauderdale Airport.

My first flight route:

- Phoenix - Dallas: 1:47am - 6:01am
- Dallas - Fort Lauderdale: 6:38am - 10:32am
- Fort Lauderdale - Lima, Peru: 5:20pm - 10:03pm

I spent 4+hrs writing 2.5 posts (this one with the Firestore post and the sections on asset links in HexoTips) at Fort Lauderdale airport. It’s really a good way to kill time and keep you awake! OK, by finishing this post, I have documented almost all key features for Hexo Development and the packing list for my trip. I completed everything in the U.S although with some delays as initially planned. But that’s it. This completes post completes all my preparation for lanVoyager in 2019!

Now, let’s start sailing...

The final painful packing process took almost 6 hours on August 18, 2019. So the final two backpacks with a crossbody ‘invisible’ bag (I stuffed it so big now it is definetly visible). Total weight is about 25kg for all three bags.

- [silk liner](https://www.rei.com/product/850427/cocoon-silk-mummy-liner?sku=8504270002&store=56&cm_mmc=PLA_Google_LIA%7C404_195857%7C8504270002%7Cnone%7C0f807a18-8860-47f4-8069-3c139f0beb1b%7Cpla-347097913619&lsft=cm_mmc:PLA_Google_LIA%7C404_195857%7C8504270002%7Cnone%7C0f807a18-8860-47f4-8069-3c139f0beb1b&kclid=0f807a18-8860-47f4-8069-3c139f0beb1b&gclid=CjwKCAjwtO7qBRBQEiwAl5WC2z9g28naPryl8AxfChQNU-QCD_oNdeC9aIpdEzutfWtVsaHW9tSoeBoCZMEQAvD_BwE) (I don’t think everybody needs this. Just for my peace of mind staying at Hostels but I may decide not to use them after exhausting days for the actual trip)
- [mosquito suit](https://www.amazon.com/Lixada-Repellent-Ultra-fine-Protective-Gardening/dp/B01I5AX9UO?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&psc=1) (I don’t know you guys but I am SUPER attractive to mosquito probably just because I am delicious to their taste...)
