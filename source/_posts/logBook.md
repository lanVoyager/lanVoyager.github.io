*Date of Publish: 08-16-2019*

Captain has no clear direction of the voyager. The objective function here is to maximize personal utility function (yet to be defined if it's ever possible) subject to allocated budget, time and captain's physical conditions. Or maybe it's a feasibility problem without a clearly defined objective function? OK, let's stop here. I have already received enough complaints about the boring contents of this blog from ALL of my test readers...

**After northern Peru (the dense marks), location marks only indicate possible major stops along the route.** At the date of publish, captain has a one-way flight ticket and 3 nights hostel reservation in Lima, Peru.
