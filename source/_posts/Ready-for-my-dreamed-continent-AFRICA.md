Procrastination and laziness! I am sorry that I failed to complete blogs on my South American trip...

At least, I am still on the move to complete my travel plan in this crazy 2020. Yes, after 2 months back in Phoenix, finally I am flying to my dreamed continent - AFRICA tomorrow!!!

{% note info %}

Name of Ship: Lan30s

Call Sign: lanVoyager.github.io

Home Port: Phoenix, AZ

Hull Identification Number (HIN): CN-SHx-99999-Ix-8x

Date of Africa Voyage Entry: 02-23-2020

Start Date of African Voyage: 4:30PM, 02-24-2020

{% endnote %}

This time the captian had rough plans for the African Voyager. Shanghai was originally planned to be the ports of calls for this African voyager and the flight ticket was purchased last December. Due to the coronavirus outbreak in China in January 2020, the captian had to cancel the voyager to China and start the African voyager directly from the home port - Phoenix, U.S. But the ship is now fully loaded although not as the original plan and captian is ready for the sailing!

# African Voyager - Ports of Calls

At the moment, again the captain only had one-way flight ticket and one-night hostel reservation.

# Planned Highlights of African Voyager:

- Sahara

- Egyptian Pyramids

- Niles

- Serengeti National Park (hopefully serveral other national parks in Africa)

- Victoria Falls

- Cute, beautiful and handsome animals!!!

  

  **First port of call in Africa: Casablanca, Morocco!**
